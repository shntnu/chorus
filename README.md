## 🚀 Get running in one lunch break

Four steps. Steps 1 + 2 are copy-paste. Step 3 is a runnable snippet. Step 4 hooks chorus up to Claude Code.

### 1. Install (5 minutes)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/pinellolab/chorus.git && cd chorus
mamba env create -f environment.yml
mamba activate chorus
python -m pip install -e .
```

Prerequisite: **Miniforge** (provides `mamba`) from <https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge>, plus **~25 GB free disk** for the default install (all 6 oracle envs + hg38 + per-oracle CDF backgrounds + 2 ChromBPNet default models — K562 and HepG2 DNase, the fast path used by every shipped notebook). Works on Linux x86_64 and macOS (Intel / Apple Silicon). A single oracle env is ~6 GB. If you opt in to `chorus setup --all-chrombpnet` to pre-cache every published ChromBPNet/BPNet model up front, plan for **~60 GB** total — the 786 individual models add ~30 GB on their own. Other ChromBPNet cell types download lazily the first time you `load_pretrained_model(...)` for them.

### 2. Download all 6 oracles + hg38 + backgrounds (~45–60 min, unattended)

```bash
chorus setup
```

One command. Pulls every oracle's weights, all background CDFs, and the hg38 reference — everything pre-downloaded so your first prediction doesn't block on a multi-GB tarball. When prompted:

- **HuggingFace token** (required — AlphaGenome is a gated model):
  1. Create a read token at <https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens>
  2. Accept the license at <https://huggingface.co/google/alphagenome-all-folds>
  3. Paste the token when `chorus setup` asks.
- **LDlink token** (optional — only for `fine_map_causal_variant`): register free at <https://ldlink.nih.gov/?tab=apiaccess>, paste when prompted. Press Enter to skip — not needed for most workflows.

> **Want to start in 2 minutes?** `chorus setup --oracle enformer` installs just the lightweight CPU starter; you can add more oracles later with `chorus setup --oracle <name>`.

### 3. Predict — wild-type + SNP effect in one block

```python
import chorus
from chorus.utils import get_genome

oracle = chorus.create_oracle(
    'enformer', use_environment=True,
    reference_fasta=str(get_genome('hg38')),
)
oracle.load_pretrained_model()

# Wild-type: DNase-seq signal at the β-globin locus in K562
wt = oracle.predict(
    ('chr11', 5247000, 5248000),
    ['ENCFF413AHU'],
)
print(f"WT mean signal: {wt['ENCFF413AHU'].values.mean():.3f}")

# Variant effect: scan every SNV at chr11:5247500 (genome has 'C' here)
effects = oracle.predict_variant_effect(
    'chr11:5247000-5248000',
    'chr11:5247500',
    ['C', 'A', 'G', 'T'],   # ref first (= genome base), then 3 alts
    ['ENCFF413AHU'],
)
n_alts = len(effects['predictions']) - 1  # minus the reference
print(f"Variant result: scored {n_alts} alt alleles "
      f"({list(effects['predictions'].keys())})")
```

### 4. Use with Claude Code

Chorus ships an MCP server with **22 tools** ([full list](#mcp-server)
under "MCP server"). Add it once:

```bash
claude mcp add chorus -- mamba run -n chorus chorus-mcp
```

Then in Claude Code:

> *"What chorus oracles are available?"* — sanity-check the connection (Claude calls `list_oracles`).

> *"Predict DNase accessibility at chr11:5,247,000–5,248,000 with Enformer for K562, then compute the effect of rs12740374 on SORT1 expression with AlphaGenome."*

Claude will use the chorus MCP tools (`list_tracks`, `predict`, `predict_variant_effect`, `analyze_variant_multilayer`, …) to answer.

### What chorus is

Chorus provides a consistent, easy-to-use API for working with state-of-the-art genomic deep learning models including:

- **Enformer**: Predicts gene expression and chromatin states from DNA sequences
- **Borzoi**: Enhanced model for regulatory genomics predictions
- **ChromBPNet / BPNet**: Predicts chromatin accessibility (ChromBPNet) and TF binding (BPNet) at base-pair resolution
- **Sei**: Sequence regulatory effect predictions — 21,907 underlying chromatin profiles aggregated into 40 sequence classes used for variant scoring
- **LegNet**: Regulatory regions activity prediction using models trained on MPRA data
- **AlphaGenome**: Google DeepMind's model predicting 5,731 genomic tracks (5,168 human-only — the CDF-backed subset chorus normalizes against; 563 mouse) at single base-pair resolution from 1MB input

Key features:
- 🧬 Unified API across different models
- 📊 Built-in visualization tools for genomic tracks
- 🔬 Variant effect prediction
- 🎯 In silico mutagenesis and sequence optimization

### Key terms

| Term | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| **Oracle** | A deep learning model that predicts regulatory activity from DNA sequence (e.g. Enformer, AlphaGenome) |
| **Track** | A single experimental measurement predicted by an oracle (e.g. DNase-seq in K562 cells) |
| **assay_id** | The unique identifier for a track, used in API calls (e.g. `"ENCFF413AHU"` or `"DNASE/EFO:0001187 DNase-seq/."`) |
| **Effect percentile** | How extreme a variant's effect is compared to ~10,000 random SNPs (≥99th = stronger than 99% of random variants) |
| **log2FC** | Log2 fold-change between alternate and reference allele predictions — the raw effect size (most layers). Gene-expression uses **lnFC** (natural log) and MPRA uses **Δ (alt−ref)**; every report states the formula used per layer. |

### Worked application examples

Every subfolder under [`examples/walkthroughs/`](examples/walkthroughs/) is a concrete, ready-to-reproduce use case with full outputs in **Markdown, JSON, TSV, and HTML** (with an embedded IGV browser):

| I want to... | Example |
|---|---|
| Analyze a GWAS / clinical variant in a specific cell type | [variant_analysis/SORT1_rs12740374](examples/walkthroughs/variant_analysis/SORT1_rs12740374/) |
| I have a variant but don't know the relevant tissue | [discovery/SORT1_cell_type_screen](examples/walkthroughs/discovery/SORT1_cell_type_screen/) |
| Fine-map a GWAS locus to the causal SNP | [causal_prioritization/SORT1_locus](examples/walkthroughs/causal_prioritization/SORT1_locus/) |
| Score a batch of variants from a VCF | [batch_scoring/](examples/walkthroughs/batch_scoring/) |
| Predict the effect of an engineered sequence edit | [sequence_engineering/region_swap](examples/walkthroughs/sequence_engineering/region_swap/) |
| Replicate a published regulatory variant finding | [validation/SORT1_rs12740374_with_CEBP](examples/walkthroughs/validation/SORT1_rs12740374_with_CEBP/) |
| Cross-validate a variant across multiple oracles | [validation/SORT1_rs12740374_multioracle](examples/walkthroughs/validation/SORT1_rs12740374_multioracle/) |

These examples were generated through Claude Code using Chorus's MCP server — the same way you'll use it. Every report preserves the original prompt at the top, so you can see exactly what was asked and reproduce it. See [`examples/walkthroughs/README.md`](examples/walkthroughs/README.md) for the full list with per-persona ("Geneticist", "Bioinformatician", "Clinician", "Computational biologist") starting points.

### Pick an oracle

Start with one or two oracles and add more with `chorus setup --oracle <name>` later. AlphaGenome is the most capable but heaviest; Enformer is the best CPU-friendly starter.

| Oracle | Minimum RAM | GPU needed? | Typical cold-predict | Best for |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Enformer** | 8 GB | optional | ~10 s (GPU) / ~1 min (CPU) | lightweight multi-track, CPU-friendly starter |
| **Borzoi** | 12 GB | recommended | ~30 s (GPU) | distal gene-expression effects, longer context |
| **ChromBPNet** | 4 GB | optional | ~1 s (CPU ok) | base-pair chromatin / motif disruption |
| **LegNet** | 4 GB | optional | <1 s | MPRA / promoter activity |
| **Sei** | 4 GB | optional | ~2 s | regulatory sequence-class profiling |
| **AlphaGenome** | 16 GB | strongly recommended | ~30 s (GPU) / 2–5 min (CPU) | comprehensive multi-layer (5,731 tracks, 1 Mb window) |

All oracles auto-detect CUDA via `torch.cuda.is_available()` / `jax.device_get`; respect `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES` to pin to a specific GPU. Pass `device='cuda'` / `'cpu'` / `'mps'` explicitly if needed. **GPU support:** NVIDIA CUDA (Linux) is auto-detected; Apple Metal is supported via `tensorflow-metal` for the TF-backed oracles (Enformer, ChromBPNet) and PyTorch MPS for the PyTorch-backed oracles (Borzoi, Sei, LegNet). AlphaGenome runs on JAX and currently falls back to CPU on Apple Silicon (the JAX-Metal backend is still maturing).

### Installation — detailed

The TLDR's `chorus setup` does everything you need. This section covers the edge cases: upgrading, per-oracle setup, token plumbing, manual genome management, and backgrounds.

> **Two env files, one source of truth.** The root `environment.yml` is what you install. The per-oracle files in `environments/` are consumed internally by `chorus setup --oracle <name>` — you don't install them directly.

#### Upgrading

After the first install, to upgrade cleanly:

```bash
cd chorus && git pull
# Remove oracle envs first (while the chorus CLI is still available):
chorus remove --oracle enformer
# Repeat for each oracle you had installed...
# Then remove the base env:
mamba env remove -n chorus -y
```

Then re-run the Fresh Install steps above.

#### Setting up oracle environments one-by-one

Chorus uses isolated conda environments for each oracle to avoid dependency conflicts between TensorFlow, PyTorch, and JAX models.

**Which oracle to start with?** For variant analysis, **AlphaGenome** is the most comprehensive (1 Mb input window, 1 bp prediction resolution, 5,731 tracks) but requires ~16 GB RAM and benefits from a GPU. **Enformer** is a good lightweight alternative that runs comfortably on CPU with ~8 GB RAM (see the table in [examples/walkthroughs/README.md](examples/walkthroughs/README.md#which-oracle-should-i-use) for a full side-by-side comparison).

```bash
# Set up each oracle individually (alternative to `chorus setup` which does all 6)
chorus setup --oracle alphagenome   # JAX-based — recommended primary oracle (see AlphaGenome section below for auth)
chorus setup --oracle enformer      # TensorFlow-based
chorus setup --oracle borzoi        # PyTorch-based
chorus setup --oracle chrombpnet    # TensorFlow-based (includes BPNet for TF binding)
chorus setup --oracle sei           # PyTorch-based
chorus setup --oracle legnet        # PyTorch-based

# List available environments
chorus list
```

Check the installation:

```bash
# Check environment health (use --timeout for first run when models download)
chorus health --timeout 300
```

**Note:** `chorus setup` pre-downloads each oracle's default weights + background CDFs + the `hg38` reference at install time, so subsequent `chorus health` / prediction calls are fast. If you opted out via `--no-weights`, the first prediction will still do a lazy download.

#### Tokens

Two tokens are relevant. `chorus setup` surfaces both so they aren't a mid-prediction surprise:

| Token | When you need it | How `chorus setup` handles it |
|---|---|---|
| `HF_TOKEN` (HuggingFace) | Required for **AlphaGenome** — the `google/alphagenome-all-folds` model is gated. | Resolved via `--hf-token` → `HF_TOKEN` / `HUGGING_FACE_HUB_TOKEN` env → existing `huggingface-cli login` → interactive prompt. `chorus setup` (bare or `--oracle all`) **halts** the whole flow if no working token can be resolved, so the other 5 oracles aren't built for nothing. |
| `LDLINK_TOKEN` | Optional — only used by `fine_map_causal_variant` (auto-fetch LD proxies from the NIH LDlink REST API). | Non-blocking prompt during `chorus setup`. If provided, stored in `~/.chorus/config.toml`; `chorus.utils.ld` also reads `LDLINK_TOKEN` from env. |

Register an HF read token at <https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens>, then accept the model license at <https://huggingface.co/google/alphagenome-all-folds>. Register a free LDlink token at <https://ldlink.nih.gov/?tab=apiaccess>.

#### Managing reference genomes

Chorus includes built-in support for downloading and managing reference genomes. `chorus setup` pulls hg38 automatically — this section is for other assemblies or manual management.

```bash
# List available genomes
chorus genome list

# Download a reference genome (e.g., hg38, hg19, mm10)
chorus genome download hg38

# Get information about a downloaded genome
chorus genome info hg38

# Remove a downloaded genome
chorus genome remove hg38
```

Supported genomes:
- **hg38**: Human genome assembly GRCh38
- **hg19**: Human genome assembly GRCh37
- **mm10**: Mouse genome assembly GRCm38
- **mm9**: Mouse genome assembly NCBI37
- **dm6**: Drosophila melanogaster genome assembly BDGP6
- **ce11**: C. elegans genome assembly WBcel235

Genomes are stored in the `genomes/` directory within your Chorus installation.

#### Per-track background distributions (auto-downloaded)

Chorus converts every raw prediction into an **effect percentile** and **activity percentile** against ~10,000 random SNPs and ~30,000 genome-wide positions scored on the same oracle. These pre-computed per-track CDFs are what let a user interpret a `+0.45` log2FC as `0.962 activity %ile`.

**Nothing to configure.** `chorus setup` pre-downloads the relevant backgrounds for every oracle. If you skipped that step, on the first variant analysis for a given oracle the backgrounds are automatically fetched from the public HuggingFace dataset [`lucapinello/chorus-backgrounds`](https://huggingface.co/datasets/lucapinello/chorus-backgrounds) and cached at `~/.chorus/backgrounds/`.

| Oracle | File size | Tracks covered |
|---|---|---|
| AlphaGenome | ~260 MB | 5,168 |
| Enformer | ~520 MB | 5,313 |
| Borzoi | ~770 MB | 7,611 |
| ChromBPNet | ~82 MB | 786 (42 ATAC/DNASE + 744 CHIP) |
| Sei | ~2.8 MB | 40 classes |
| LegNet | ~210 KB | 3 cell types |

> **The backgrounds dataset is public — no HuggingFace token required.** `HF_TOKEN` is only needed for the gated AlphaGenome model itself (see [Tokens](#tokens) above). Causal prioritization with auto-LD-fetch needs a separate free LDlink token.

To pre-download by hand:

```python
from chorus.analysis.normalization import download_pertrack_backgrounds
for oracle in ["alphagenome", "enformer", "borzoi", "chrombpnet", "sei", "legnet"]:
    download_pertrack_backgrounds(oracle)
```

### Python API

> **Prefer a notebook?** Open [`examples/notebooks/single_oracle_quickstart.ipynb`](examples/notebooks/single_oracle_quickstart.ipynb) for a full walkthrough using Enformer + the GATA1 locus. The recipes below are the minimum viable snippets.
>
> **Prerequisite:** you've run `chorus setup` (or at least `chorus setup --oracle enformer`).

#### Minimal working example

```python
import chorus
from chorus.utils import get_genome

# 1. Create oracle with reference genome
genome_path = get_genome('hg38')  # auto-downloads if needed
oracle = chorus.create_oracle('enformer', use_environment=True,
                              reference_fasta=str(genome_path))
oracle.load_pretrained_model()

# 2. Predict DNase accessibility at the beta-globin locus.
#    'ENCFF413AHU' is the ENCODE track ID for DNase-seq in K562 cells.
#    See "Discovering tracks" below to find track IDs for other assays /
#    cell types, or use the `list_tracks` MCP tool from Claude Code.
predictions = oracle.predict(('chr11', 5247000, 5248000), ['ENCFF413AHU'])

# 3. Check the result
track = predictions['ENCFF413AHU']
print(f"Mean signal: {track.values.mean():.2f}, Max: {track.values.max():.2f}")
```

#### Discovering tracks

Each oracle has thousands of tracks. Use the metadata to find the right ones:

```python
# List available assay types
print(oracle.list_assay_types())   # ['ATAC', 'CAGE', 'CHIP', 'DNASE']

# Search for tracks by keyword (e.g. cell type)
from chorus.oracles.enformer_source.enformer_metadata import get_metadata
meta = get_metadata()
k562_tracks = meta.search_tracks('K562')  # Returns DataFrame with 'identifier' column
print(k562_tracks[['identifier', 'description']].head())

# Use the 'identifier' column as track IDs for predictions
tracks = ['ENCFF413AHU', 'CNhs11250']  # DNase:K562, CAGE:K562
```

> **Tip:** Each oracle has different track naming. Enformer and Borzoi use ENCODE identifiers (e.g. `ENCFF413AHU`). ChromBPNet uses assay + cell type. AlphaGenome uses `{OutputType}/{TrackName}/{Strand}`. See the [Model-specific details](#model-specific-details) section for each oracle's track format.

#### 1. Wild-type prediction

```python
# Predict from genomic coordinates
predictions = oracle.predict(
    ('chr11', 5247000, 5248000),  # Beta-globin locus
    tracks
)

# Or from DNA sequence
sequence = 'ACGT' * 98304  # 393,216 bp for Enformer
predictions = oracle.predict(sequence, tracks)
```

#### 2. Region replacement

```python
# Replace a 200bp region with enhancer sequence
enhancer = 'GATA' * 50  # 200bp GATA motif repeats
replaced = oracle.predict_region_replacement(
    'chr11:5247400-5247600',  # Region to replace
    enhancer,                  # New sequence
    tracks
)
```

#### 3. Sequence insertion

```python
# Insert enhancer at specific position
inserted = oracle.predict_region_insertion_at(
    'chr11:5247500',  # Insertion point
    enhancer,         # Sequence to insert
    tracks
)
```

#### 4. Variant effect

```python
# Test SNP effects (e.g., A→G mutation)
variant_effects = oracle.predict_variant_effect(
    'chr11:5247000-5248000',  # Region containing variant
    'chr11:5247500',          # Variant position
    ['A', 'G', 'C', 'T'],     # Reference first, then alternates
    tracks
)
```

#### 5. Sub-region scoring

```python
# Score a specific peak or promoter within the prediction window
# (instead of summarizing the entire 114 kb output)
score = predictions.score_region('chr11', 5247400, 5247600, 'mean')
# Returns {track_id: score} for all tracks

# Also available on individual tracks with different strategies
track = predictions['ENCFF413AHU']
track.score_region('chr11', 5247400, 5247600, 'max')   # peak signal
track.score_region('chr11', 5247400, 5247600, 'sum')   # total signal
```

#### 6. Focused variant effect scoring

```python
from chorus.core.result import score_variant_effect

# Score variant effects at the variant site (±N bins)
scores = score_variant_effect(variant_effects, at_variant=True, window_bins=2)
# Returns {allele: {track_id: {ref_score, alt_score, effect}}}

# Or score variant effects at a specific region (e.g. a nearby promoter)
scores = score_variant_effect(
    variant_effects,
    chrom='chr11', start=5247400, end=5247600,
    scoring_strategy='mean'  # mean, max, sum, median, or abs_max
)
```

#### 7. Gene expression analysis

```python
# Quantify predicted gene expression from CAGE and/or RNA-seq tracks
# Auto-detects expression tracks and uses appropriate quantification:
#   CAGE/LentiMPRA → TSS windowed max
#   RNA-seq → exon sum (Borzoi/AlphaGenome)
expr = oracle.analyze_gene_expression(predictions, 'GATA1')
# Returns per-track expression values with quantification method

# Also available: get exon annotations for a gene
from chorus.utils.annotations import get_gene_exons
exons = get_gene_exons('GATA1')  # merged exon coordinates
```

#### 8. Variant effect on gene expression

```python
# The key question: does this variant change expression of a gene?
result = oracle.analyze_variant_effect_on_gene(variant_effects, 'GATA1')
# Returns fold change, log2 fold change, and absolute change per allele per track
```

#### 9. Save predictions

```python
# Save as BedGraph for genome browser
wt_files = predictions.save_predictions_as_bedgraph(output_dir="bedgraph_outputs",
                                                    prefix='a_wt')

```

### Notebooks

Three notebooks are provided, from introductory to advanced (all work once `chorus setup` has completed):

| Notebook | Oracles | What it covers |
|----------|---------|----------------|
| `examples/notebooks/single_oracle_quickstart.ipynb` | Enformer | Deep single-oracle tutorial: predictions, region replacement, insertion, variant effects, gene expression, coolbox visualization |
| `examples/notebooks/comprehensive_oracle_showcase.ipynb` | All 6 | All oracles side by side, cross-oracle comparison, variant analysis with gene expression, sub-region scoring |
| `examples/notebooks/advanced_multi_oracle_analysis.ipynb` | Enformer + ChromBPNet/BPNet + LegNet | CHIP-seq TF binding, strand-specific tracks, Interval API, effect-percentile normalization, cell-type switching |

### MCP server

Chorus includes an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server that lets AI assistants like Claude directly load oracles, predict variant effects, and analyze gene expression — all through natural language conversation. The TLDR above covered the one-liner; this section has the full details.

#### Setup for Claude Code

**You do NOT need to run the server manually.** Claude Code manages the MCP server process automatically. You just need a `.mcp.json` file — and it works from **any project folder**, not just the Chorus repo.

**Step 1:** One-liner — run this from any project folder:

```bash
curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pinellolab/chorus/main/.mcp.json -o .mcp.json
```

Or create `.mcp.json` manually:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "chorus": {
      "type": "stdio",
      "command": "mamba",
      "args": ["run", "-n", "chorus", "chorus-mcp"],
      "env": {
        "CHORUS_NO_TIMEOUT": "1"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

The `chorus-mcp` command is installed in the `chorus` conda environment, so `mamba run -n chorus chorus-mcp` works from any directory.

> **Note:** If you use `conda` instead of `mamba`, replace `"command": "mamba"` with `"command": "conda"`. The `CHORUS_NO_TIMEOUT` env var disables prediction timeouts, which is recommended for interactive use.

**Step 2:** Start (or restart) Claude Code from your project:

```bash
cd /path/to/my-project    # any folder — does NOT need to be the chorus repo
claude
```

Claude Code reads `.mcp.json` on startup and launches the MCP server in the background. You should see the Chorus tools available immediately — try asking: *"What oracles are available?"*

**Alternatively**, you can add Chorus to your global Claude Code settings (`~/.claude/settings.json`) so it's available in every project without needing a per-project `.mcp.json`:

```bash
# Add globally (one-time setup):
claude mcp add chorus -- mamba run -n chorus chorus-mcp
```

#### Setup for Claude Desktop

Add this to your Claude Desktop MCP config (`~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json` on macOS):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "chorus": {
      "command": "mamba",
      "args": ["run", "-n", "chorus", "chorus-mcp"],
      "env": {
        "CHORUS_NO_TIMEOUT": "1"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Then restart Claude Desktop. Chorus tools will be available in all conversations.

#### Manual testing (optional)

You can verify the server starts correctly by running it directly:

```bash
mamba run -n chorus chorus-mcp
# You should see the FastMCP banner. Press Ctrl+C to stop.
```

#### Available MCP tools

- **Discovery**: `list_oracles`, `list_tracks`, `list_genomes`, `get_genes_in_region`, `get_gene_tss`
- **Lifecycle**: `load_oracle`, `unload_oracle`, `oracle_status`
- **Low-level prediction**: `predict`, `predict_variant_effect`, `predict_region_replacement`, `predict_region_insertion`
- **Scoring primitives**: `score_prediction_region`, `score_variant_effect_at_region`, `predict_variant_effect_on_gene`
- **Multi-layer analysis (recommended for most users)**:
    - `analyze_variant_multilayer` — score a variant across chromatin, TF, histone, CAGE, RNA, splicing in one call
    - `discover_variant` — find top tracks/cell types for a variant without pre-selecting assays
    - `discover_variant_cell_types` — screen hundreds of cell types to find where a variant matters most
    - `score_variant_batch` — rank many variants (VCF / GWAS set / credible set) by effect magnitude
    - `fine_map_causal_variant` — prioritize the causal SNP in a GWAS locus using multi-layer convergence
    - `analyze_region_swap`, `simulate_integration` — score sequence engineering edits (promoter swaps, construct insertions)

Every analysis tool accepts an optional `user_prompt` parameter and writes it into the top of the report so an HTML/MD opened later still shows the original question. See [`examples/walkthroughs/`](examples/walkthroughs/) for worked outputs of each tool, or read the [MCP Walkthrough](docs/MCP_WALKTHROUGH.md) for a step-by-step guide showing what you type in Claude and what comes back.

Key features:
- **Auto-centering**: `region` is optional in variant tools — auto-sized for each oracle's output window
- **ChromBPNet/BPNet params**: `load_oracle("chrombpnet", assay="CHIP", cell_type="K562", TF="GATA1")`
- **TSS warnings**: `predict_variant_effect_on_gene` warns when the target gene TSS is outside the output window
- **Mixed-resolution**: AlphaGenome's 1bp DNASE + 128bp histone tracks score correctly in a single call

#### Variant analysis with AlphaGenome (recommended)

AlphaGenome (1Mb window, 5731 tracks) is the recommended primary oracle for variant analysis. It covers DNASE, ATAC, CAGE, RNA-seq, ChIP-seq histone marks, and TF binding in a single model.

Example conversation with Claude:

> **You:** *Load AlphaGenome and predict the effect of rs12740374 (chr1:109274968 G>T) on hepatocyte CAGE expression*
>
> Claude will call `load_oracle("alphagenome")`, then `predict_variant_effect(...)` with the right tracks, and return a summary of chromatin and expression effects.

See `docs/variant_analysis_framework.md` for the full 5-layer analysis guide with track selection cheat sheets by disease area.

### Key features

#### 1. Environment isolation

Each oracle runs in its own conda environment to avoid dependency conflicts:

```python
# TensorFlow-based Enformer runs in isolated environment
enformer = chorus.create_oracle('enformer', use_environment=True)

# PyTorch-based Borzoi runs in its own isolated environment
borzoi = chorus.create_oracle('borzoi', use_environment=True)
```

#### 2. Reference genome integration

For accurate predictions, provide a reference genome to extract proper flanking sequences:

```python
# Enformer requires 393,216 bp of context
# Chorus automatically extracts and pads sequences from the reference

# Option 1: Using get_genome() - simplest approach
from chorus.utils import get_genome
genome_path = get_genome('hg38')  # Auto-downloads if not present
oracle = chorus.create_oracle('enformer', 
                             use_environment=True,
                             reference_fasta=str(genome_path))

# Option 2: Using GenomeManager directly
from chorus.utils import GenomeManager
gm = GenomeManager()
genome_path = gm.get_genome('hg38')  # Auto-downloads if needed
oracle = chorus.create_oracle('enformer', 
                             use_environment=True,
                             reference_fasta=str(genome_path))

# Predict using genomic coordinates
predictions = oracle.predict(('chr1', 1000000, 1001000), ['DNase:K562'])
```

#### 3. Track support

Track identifiers vary by oracle. Use the metadata search (see [Discovering tracks](#discovering-tracks)) to find the right IDs.

For Enformer and Borzoi, you can use ENCODE identifiers or descriptive names in the Python API:
```python
# ENCODE identifier (recommended — works in both Python API and MCP)
predictions = oracle.predict(sequence, ['ENCFF413AHU'])  # DNase:K562

# Descriptive name (Python API only)
predictions = oracle.predict(sequence, ['DNase:K562'])

# CAGE identifier
predictions = oracle.predict(sequence, ['CNhs11250'])  # CAGE:K562
```

> **MCP users:** The MCP server requires ENCODE identifiers (e.g. `ENCFF413AHU`), not descriptive names. Use `list_tracks(oracle_name, query='K562')` to search and get the `identifier` field.

#### 4. BedGraph output

Predictions can be saved as BedGraph tracks for genome browser visualization:

```python
# Predictions are returned as numpy arrays
# Each bin represents 128 bp for Enformer
# See examples for BedGraph generation code
```

### Core concepts

#### Oracles
Oracles are deep learning models that predict genomic regulatory activity. Each oracle implements a common interface while running in isolated environments.

#### Intervals

A unified interface to genomic coordinates and reference sequences. Intervals track sequence edits alongside their corresponding model predictions, supporting reproducible in silico perturbation workflows and consistent downstream analysis.

#### Tracks
Tracks represent genomic signal data (e.g., DNase-seq, ChIP-seq). Enformer predicts 5,313 human tracks covering various assays and cell types.

#### Environment management
The `chorus` CLI manages conda environments for each oracle:

```bash
# Set up environments
chorus setup --oracle enformer

# Check health
chorus health

# Clean up
chorus remove --oracle enformer
```

#### Managing CDF backgrounds

```bash
# View background status for all oracles
chorus backgrounds status

# View details for one oracle (shows ATAC/DNASE vs CHIP breakdown for ChromBPNet)
chorus backgrounds status --oracle chrombpnet

# Build CDFs for any tracks not yet in the NPZ (e.g. after registering a
# new ChromBPNet model in chrombpnet_globals.py — see the BYOM walkthrough
# in docs/NORMALIZATION_GUIDE.md)
chorus backgrounds build --oracle chrombpnet --only-missing --gpu 0

# Append tracks from a user-built NPZ
chorus backgrounds add-tracks --oracle chrombpnet --npz my_custom_cdfs.npz
```

See [`docs/NORMALIZATION_GUIDE.md`](docs/NORMALIZATION_GUIDE.md) for walkthroughs on bringing custom ChromBPNet/LegNet models and adding new oracles.

### Model-specific details

#### ChromBPNet / BPNet

Base-pair resolution for chromatin accessibility and TF binding predictions. This oracle supports two model types through the same interface:

- **ChromBPNet** (`assay="DNASE"` or `assay="ATAC"`): Predicts chromatin accessibility at base-pair resolution. Models are downloaded from ENCODE.
- **BPNet** (`assay="CHIP"`, `TF="GATA1"`): Predicts transcription factor binding at base-pair resolution. Models are downloaded from JASPAR.

Specs:
- Sequence length: 2,114 bp input
- Output: 1,000 bins at 1 bp resolution
- Track types: DNase/ATAC accessibility, TF binding (ChIP-seq)

```python
# ChromBPNet: chromatin accessibility
oracle = chorus.create_oracle('chrombpnet', use_environment=True,
                              reference_fasta=str(genome_path))
oracle.load_pretrained_model(assay="DNASE", cell_type="K562")

# BPNet: TF-specific binding prediction
oracle.load_pretrained_model(assay="CHIP", cell_type="K562", TF="GATA1")
```

##### Loading custom models

You can load your own ChromBPNet/BPNet weights (e.g. trained on a new cell type):

```python
oracle.load_pretrained_model(
    assay="DNASE",                   # DNASE, ATAC, or CHIP
    cell_type="HepG2",              # your cell type label
    weights='path/to/weights',      # path to your model weights
    is_custom=True                  # enables custom weight paths
)

- Sequence length: 1,048,576 bp (1 MB) input
- Output: 1,048,576 bins at single base-pair resolution
- Bin size: 1 bp (ATAC, CAGE, DNase, RNA-seq, splice sites, PRO-CAP) or 128 bp (ChIP-seq histone/TF)
- Track types: ATAC, CAGE, ChIP-seq (histone + TF), DNase, RNA-seq, Splice sites, PRO-CAP
- Track identifiers: `{OutputType}/{TrackName}/{Strand}` (e.g., `ATAC/CL:0000084 ATAC-seq/.`)
- Weights: Hosted on HuggingFace (gated repository, requires authentication)

##### AlphaGenome setup

AlphaGenome weights are hosted on a **gated HuggingFace repository**. You must authenticate before first use — this is what the interactive prompt in `chorus setup` handles for you. If you want to set it up manually:

1. **Create a HuggingFace account** at <https://huggingface.co/join>
2. **Accept the model license terms** at <https://huggingface.co/google/alphagenome-all-folds> (click "Agree and access repository")
3. **Generate a token** at <https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens> (read access is sufficient)
4. **Authenticate** via one of these methods:

```bash
# Option A: Set environment variable (recommended — works with automation and across envs)
export HF_TOKEN="hf_your_token_here"

# Option B: Interactive login (saves token to ~/.cache/huggingface/token)
mamba run -n chorus-alphagenome huggingface-cli login
```

> **For MCP users**: Claude Code inherits environment variables from the shell where you start `claude`. Make sure `HF_TOKEN` is exported in that shell (e.g. add the `export` to your `~/.bashrc` or `~/.zshrc`). Option B (cached token) also works without any shell export.

5. **Set up the environment and verify**:

```bash
chorus setup --oracle alphagenome
chorus health --oracle alphagenome --timeout 300
```

##### AlphaGenome usage

```python
import chorus
from chorus.utils import get_genome

genome_path = get_genome('hg38')

# Create and load oracle
oracle = chorus.create_oracle('alphagenome',
                              use_environment=True,
                              reference_fasta=str(genome_path),
                              device='cpu')  # or omit for auto-detect GPU
oracle.load_pretrained_model()

# Discover available tracks
print(oracle.list_assay_types())   # ['ATAC', 'CAGE', 'CHIP', 'DNASE', ...]
print(oracle.get_track_info('ATAC'))  # DataFrame of ATAC tracks

# Predict
tracks = ['ATAC/CL:0000084 ATAC-seq/.']  # T-cell ATAC-seq
predictions = oracle.predict(('chr1', 1_000_000, 2_048_576), tracks)
```

##### AlphaGenome GPU support

AlphaGenome uses JAX, which supports multiple accelerator backends:

- **NVIDIA GPU (Linux)**: Automatically installs `jax[cuda12]` when NVIDIA GPU is detected during `chorus setup`
- **Apple Silicon (macOS)**: Uses **CPU** by default. `jax-metal` is installed but the Metal backend is experimental and does not yet support all operations AlphaGenome requires (e.g., `default_memory_space`). You can explicitly try `device='metal'` but expect errors.
- **CPU**: Works everywhere as fallback; pass `device='cpu'` to force CPU

```python
# Auto-detect best available device (CUDA GPU > CPU; Metal skipped for AlphaGenome)
oracle = chorus.create_oracle('alphagenome', use_environment=True)

# Force specific device
oracle = chorus.create_oracle('alphagenome', use_environment=True, device='cpu')
oracle = chorus.create_oracle('alphagenome', use_environment=True, device='gpu')    # NVIDIA CUDA
```

### Troubleshooting

#### Device selection

By default, Chorus auto-detects and uses GPU if available. You can explicitly control device selection:

```python
oracle = chorus.create_oracle('enformer', use_environment=True,
                              reference_fasta=str(genome_path),
                              device='cpu')       # Force CPU
# Or: device='cuda:1' for a specific GPU
# Or: export CHORUS_DEVICE=cpu
```

#### Timeout issues

For slower systems or CPU-only environments, you may need to adjust timeouts:

```python
oracle = chorus.create_oracle('enformer', use_environment=True,
                              reference_fasta=str(genome_path),
                              model_load_timeout=1800,  # 30 min (default 600)
                              predict_timeout=900)      # 15 min (default 300)

# Or disable all timeouts globally
# export CHORUS_NO_TIMEOUT=1
```

Common timeout scenarios:
- **Model loading**: First-time downloads can be slow (~1GB model)
- **CPU predictions**: GPU is 10-100x faster than CPU
- **Network filesystems**: Add 50% to timeouts for NFS/shared storage

#### Environment issues
```bash
# Check if environment exists
chorus health

# Recreate environment
chorus remove --oracle enformer
chorus setup --oracle enformer
```

##### Two mamba installs ⇒ `chorus health` reports phantom failures

If you have both `~/.local/share/mamba/` (typical when `mamba` is installed via brew/pip) **and** a `~/miniforge3/` (typical when you originally installed via the Miniforge installer), `mamba env create` may put the new `chorus` env in one root while the per-oracle `chorus-*` envs live in the other. `chorus health` then fails with `mamba list -n chorus-<oracle>` returning non-zero because the running mamba is looking under the wrong root.

**Fix:** point `MAMBA_ROOT_PREFIX` at the root that contains the oracle envs before invoking `chorus`:

```bash
export MAMBA_ROOT_PREFIX=$HOME/miniforge3   # or wherever your chorus-* envs live
mamba env list                              # confirm chorus-* envs show up
chorus health
```

Add the export to your shell rc file if you want it persistent.

##### Enformer fails with `saved_model.pb` not found after a partial download

TensorFlow Hub caches downloaded models at `/var/folders/.../T/tfhub_modules/` (macOS) or `/tmp/tfhub_modules/` (Linux). **This cache is outside `~/.chorus/` and survives chorus teardowns.** If an earlier Enformer download was interrupted, the cached directory ends up missing `saved_model.pb` and Enformer fails to load with:

```
Trying to load a model of incompatible/unknown type. ... contains
neither 'saved_model.pb' nor 'saved_model.pbtxt'.
```

Clear the stale cache and retry:

```bash
# macOS
rm -rf /var/folders/*/*/T/tfhub_modules

# Linux
rm -rf /tmp/tfhub_modules
```

Chorus auto-detects the corrupted-cache case and clears it on the next `load_pretrained_model()` call, so this is only an issue if the first attempt after a fresh install fails — the second attempt will recover automatically.

#### Memory issues
Some oracles require a significant memory (~8-16 GB) for predictions. Solutions:
- Force CPU usage: `device='cpu'`
- Use a different GPU: `device='cuda:1'`
- Reduce batch size if needed

#### AlphaGenome authentication
AlphaGenome weights are hosted on a gated HuggingFace repository. If you see a `GatedRepoError` or 403 error:

```bash
# 1. Accept model terms at https://huggingface.co/google/alphagenome-all-folds
# 2. Authenticate via environment variable (recommended)
export HF_TOKEN="hf_your_token_here"
# Or: mamba run -n chorus-alphagenome huggingface-cli login
```

#### LDlink token (for causal prioritization)
The `fine_map_causal_variant` tool can auto-fetch LD proxies from LDlink. This requires a free token — register at <https://ldlink.nih.gov/?tab=apiaccess> and pass it via the `ldlink_token` parameter or set:

```bash
export LDLINK_TOKEN="your_token_here"
```

Without a token, you can still use fine-mapping by providing LD variants manually via the `ld_variants` parameter (see [causal_prioritization/](examples/walkthroughs/causal_prioritization/)).

#### CUDA / GPU support
The isolated environments include GPU support. On Linux with NVIDIA GPUs, Chorus auto-detects CUDA and installs GPU-enabled packages during `chorus setup`.

**On macOS with Apple Silicon**, Chorus auto-detects Apple GPU acceleration where supported:

| Oracle | Backend | macOS GPU path |
|---|---|---|
| Borzoi, Sei, LegNet | PyTorch | **MPS** auto-detected via `torch.backends.mps.is_available()` |
| ChromBPNet, Enformer | TensorFlow | **Metal** via `tensorflow-metal` (added automatically by `chorus setup` on macOS arm64) |
| AlphaGenome | JAX | **CPU** — `jax-metal` is installed but Apple's plugin doesn't yet support all ops AlphaGenome needs (e.g. `default_memory_space`); Chorus falls back to CPU |

You can always force a specific device:
```python
oracle = chorus.create_oracle('borzoi', use_environment=True, device='mps')   # Apple GPU
oracle = chorus.create_oracle('borzoi', use_environment=True, device='cpu')   # force CPU
oracle = chorus.create_oracle('borzoi', use_environment=True, device='cuda:0')  # NVIDIA
```

To force CPU usage when GPU causes issues:
```python
oracle = chorus.create_oracle('enformer',
                             use_environment=True,
                             device='cpu')
```

### Contributing

We welcome contributions! Areas needing work:

1. Add more examples and tutorials
2. Implement batch prediction optimizations
3. Add more visualization utilities
4. Add more oracles 

#### Adding new oracles

We've designed Chorus to make it easy to add new genomic prediction models. Each oracle runs in its own isolated conda environment, avoiding dependency conflicts between different frameworks (TensorFlow, PyTorch, JAX, etc.).

**For a complete step-by-step walkthrough, see [`docs/NORMALIZATION_GUIDE.md` → "Adding a new oracle"](docs/NORMALIZATION_GUIDE.md#walkthrough-adding-a-new-oracle).** It covers: creating the oracle class, registering it, creating the conda environment, writing the CDF build script, uploading backgrounds to HuggingFace, and a verification checklist.

Key steps:
1. Inherit from `OracleBase` and implement `load_pretrained_model()`, `list_assay_types()`, `list_cell_types()`
2. Register in `chorus/oracles/__init__.py`
3. Create `environments/chorus-myoracle.yml`
4. Write `scripts/build_backgrounds_myoracle.py` for CDF normalization
5. Upload backgrounds to `lucapinello/chorus-backgrounds` on HuggingFace
6. Submit a PR with your implementation

### Appendix: per-track background distributions

This appendix describes how the per-track CDFs that power Chorus's effect/activity percentiles were computed, what the numbers mean, and how to use them from both the Python API and an MCP/Claude session.

#### What they are and why they exist

A raw `log2FC = +0.45` in a DNase-seq track is hard to interpret. Is it strong? Is the underlying region even active? The per-track backgrounds turn that raw number into two complementary genome-aware percentiles:

| Percentile | What it measures | Computed from |
|---|---|---|
| **Effect percentile** | How unusual is *this* variant's effect on this track? | The distribution of variant-effect scores from ~10K random SNPs scored on the same track |
| **Activity percentile** | How active is the reference signal at the variant site, genome-wide? | The distribution of window-summed signal at ~31.5K diverse genomic positions |

Both range `[0, 1]` for unsigned layers (chromatin, ChIP, CAGE, splicing). For signed layers (gene expression, MPRA, Sei), the effect percentile ranges `[-1, 1]` (preserving the direction of effect).

The backgrounds are stored as 10,000-point CDFs per track in NPZ files (one file per oracle, `~/.chorus/backgrounds/{oracle}_pertrack.npz`). Each oracle's NPZ contains three matrices:

- `effect_cdfs (n_tracks × 10000)` — for the effect percentile
- `summary_cdfs (n_tracks × 10000)` — for the activity percentile
- `perbin_cdfs (n_tracks × 10000)` — for IGV per-bin rescaling (omitted for scalar-output oracles like Sei and LegNet)

#### How they were calculated

The build scripts live in [`scripts/`](scripts/) — one per oracle. Each performs three reservoir-sampled passes:

##### 1. Variant effect distribution

10,000 random SNPs sampled uniformly across `chr1`–`chr22`, well away from chromosome edges. For each SNP:

1. Predict reference and alternate alleles across the full output window.
2. For each track, score the variant effect using the layer-specific formula:
   - **log2FC** for unsigned signal layers (chromatin, TF binding, histone marks, TSS) — variant effect = `log2((sum_alt + ε) / (sum_ref + ε))` in a layer-appropriate window (501 bp for DNase/ChIP-TF/CAGE, 2001 bp for histone marks, full transcript for RNA).
   - **lnFC** for gene expression — `ln((mean_alt + ε) / (mean_ref + ε))` (natural log) averaged over GENCODE protein-coding exons of the target gene.
   - **diff** for promoter MPRA — simple `alt - ref` activity difference.
3. Add `|effect|` (unsigned) or raw `effect` (signed) to that track's reservoir.

Result: per-track histograms over real human-genome variant effects.

##### 2. Activity (window-sum) distribution

~31,500 positions per track sampled to approximate the genome-wide distribution of regulatory activity:

| Position type | Count | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| Random intergenic | 15,000 | Genome-wide null (most genome is silent) |
| ENCODE SCREEN cCREs (per category) | ~11,500 | PLS, dELS, pELS, CA-CTCF, CA-TF, TF, CA-H3K4me3, CA |
| Protein-coding TSSs | 3,000 | Sharp signals: CAGE, H3K4me3, promoter activity |
| Gene-body midpoints (>10 kb genes) | 2,000 | RNA-seq, H3K36me3, broad gene-body marks |

For each position, the layer-appropriate window-sum is added to the track's reservoir.

**RNA-seq exon-precise sampling** (Borzoi, AlphaGenome): RNA tracks only collect bins overlapping merged GENCODE v48 protein-coding exons — intronic bins would distort the activity baseline.

**CAGE summary routing**: CAGE tracks skip cCRE positions for the summary CDF since CAGE biology lives at TSSs, not enhancers.

##### 3. Per-bin distribution (for IGV visualization)

At each of the same ~31,500 positions, **32 random bins** from the full output window are added to the perbin reservoir. This captures the per-bin (not per-window) distribution at the track's native resolution (1 bp for ATAC/CAGE/RNA/PRO-CAP/splice; 128 bp for ChIP-Histone/TF in AlphaGenome).

The per-bin CDFs are used by `perbin_floor_rescale_batch` to rescale raw IGV bin values onto a uniform `[0, 1.5]` display scale where `1.0` always corresponds to the top-1% genome-wide bin value for that track. This makes overlaid tracks visually comparable across cell types.

#### Sample sizes per oracle

| Oracle | Tracks | Effect samples / track | Activity samples / track | NPZ size |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| AlphaGenome | 5,168 | 10,000 | 31,500 | 260 MB |
| Enformer | 5,313 | 10,000 | 31,500 | 520 MB |
| Borzoi | 7,611 | 10,000 | 31,500 | 770 MB |
| ChromBPNet | 786 (42 ATAC/DNASE + 744 CHIP) | 10,000 | 31,500 | 82 MB |
| Sei | 40 classes | 10,000 | 31,500 | 2.8 MB |
| LegNet | 3 cell types | 10,000 | 31,500 | 210 KB |

Effect and activity reservoirs are converted to 10,000-point CDFs (sorted sample arrays) — so a percentile lookup is a single O(log n) bisect.

#### Using backgrounds from the Python API

Auto-load (downloads from HuggingFace if not cached):

```python
from chorus.analysis.normalization import get_pertrack_normalizer

norm = get_pertrack_normalizer("alphagenome")
# → ~/.chorus/backgrounds/alphagenome_pertrack.npz (auto-downloaded if missing)
```

Look up an effect or activity percentile for a single track:

```python
track_id = "DNASE/EFO:0001187 DNase-seq/."  # HepG2 DNase

# How unusual is a +0.45 log2FC effect? (unsigned: pass abs value)
eff_pct = norm.effect_percentile("alphagenome", track_id, abs(0.45),
                                 signed=False)
# → 0.962  (stronger than 96.2% of random SNPs in this track)

# How active is the reference signal at the variant site?
act_pct = norm.activity_percentile("alphagenome", track_id, ref_value=512.0)
# → 0.962  (top 4% of genome-wide regulatory activity for this track)
```

Pass it into the analysis layer to get percentiles attached to every report:

```python
from chorus.analysis.variant_report import build_variant_report

report = build_variant_report(
    variant_result,
    oracle_name="alphagenome",
    gene_name="SORT1",
    normalizer=norm,    # ← this is what populates the Effect %ile / Activity %ile columns
)
```

Or pre-download all six oracles' backgrounds once:

```python
from chorus.analysis.normalization import download_pertrack_backgrounds
for o in ["alphagenome", "enformer", "borzoi", "chrombpnet", "sei", "legnet"]:
    download_pertrack_backgrounds(o)
```

#### Using backgrounds via MCP / Claude

You don't have to do anything. The MCP server auto-attaches the appropriate normalizer when you call any analysis tool (`analyze_variant_multilayer`, `score_variant_batch`, `fine_map_causal_variant`, `analyze_region_swap`, `simulate_integration`, `discover_variant`, `discover_variant_cell_types`).

The first call for a given oracle triggers a one-time HuggingFace download (a few hundred MB), cached at `~/.chorus/backgrounds/`. Subsequent calls reuse the cache.

In the resulting report, every track row gets two extra columns — `Effect %ile` and `Activity %ile` — and the IGV browser uses the per-bin CDFs to rescale bin heights for cross-cell-type comparability.

#### Documented ranges and how to read the numbers

| Column | Range | Reading |
|---|---|---|
| **Raw effect** (e.g. log2FC) | unbounded; biologically meaningful units | `+1.0` = alt is 2× ref; `-1.0` = alt is 0.5× ref |
| **Effect percentile** (unsigned) | `[0, 1]` | `0.95` = stronger than 95% of ~10K random SNPs in the same track |
| **Effect percentile** (signed) | `[-1, 1]` | `+0.95` = strongly above-baseline gain; `-0.95` = strongly above-baseline loss |
| **Activity percentile** | `[0, 1]` | `0.95` = reference signal at this site is in the top 5% genome-wide for this track |
| **IGV per-bin display value** | `[0, 1.5]` | `1.0` = top-1% bin value genome-wide for this track; `0` = below the noise floor |

**Sanity-check rule of thumb:** a *biologically interesting* variant typically shows **effect percentile > 0.95** AND **activity percentile > 0.5** in the same track — i.e. an unusually large effect at a site that already has real regulatory activity.

A high effect percentile with very low activity is usually noise (small absolute change at a silent site that just happens to be larger than most random-SNP-at-silent-sites changes).

#### Reproducing or extending the backgrounds

Each oracle has a build script at `scripts/build_backgrounds_<oracle>.py`. Each takes ~4–22 GPU-hours per oracle depending on the track count and output window. To rebuild a single oracle:

```bash
mamba run -n chorus-alphagenome python scripts/build_backgrounds_alphagenome.py --part variants  --gpu 0
mamba run -n chorus-alphagenome python scripts/build_backgrounds_alphagenome.py --part baselines --gpu 1
mamba run -n chorus              python scripts/build_backgrounds_alphagenome.py --part merge
```

The variants and baselines parts can run in parallel on separate GPUs. The merge step runs CPU-only and combines the interim NPZ files into the final `{oracle}_pertrack.npz`. See [`scripts/README.md`](scripts/README.md) for the full per-oracle commands and runtimes.

If you've rebuilt a background and want to share it: drop the resulting `{oracle}_pertrack.npz` into `~/.chorus/backgrounds/`. The downloader will not overwrite local files — it only fetches when the file is missing.
