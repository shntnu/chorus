## ⚠️ Current Status

 Currently, Enformer, Sei, Borzoi, ChromBPNet, LegNet and AlphaGenome oracles are fully implemented with:

- Environment isolation support
- Reference genome integration for biologically accurate predictions
- ENCODE track identifier support
- BedGraph output generation

## Prerequisites

- **Miniforge** (provides `mamba`): Install from https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge
- **Git**
- ~20 GB free disk space (for models, genomes, and conda environments)
- Works on **Linux x86_64** and **macOS (Intel/Apple Silicon)**. GPU support is auto-detected.

## Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/pinellolab/chorus.git
cd chorus

# Create the base chorus environment
mamba env create -f environment.yml
mamba activate chorus

# Install chorus package
pip install -e .

# Verify installation
python -c "import chorus; print(f'chorus {chorus.__version__}')"
```

### Setting Up Oracle Environments

Chorus uses isolated conda environments for each oracle to avoid dependency conflicts between TensorFlow, PyTorch, and JAX models:

```bash
# Set up all oracle environments
chorus setup --oracle enformer      # TensorFlow-based
chorus setup --oracle borzoi        # PyTorch-based
chorus setup --oracle chrombpnet    # TensorFlow-based
chorus setup --oracle sei           # PyTorch-based
chorus setup --oracle legnet        # PyTorch-based
chorus setup --oracle alphagenome   # JAX-based (see AlphaGenome section below for auth)

# List available environments
chorus list
```

You can check the correctness of installation using the following command:

```bash
# Check environment health (use --timeout for first run when models download)
chorus health --timeout 300
```

**Note:** The first health check (or first prediction) for each oracle may take several minutes as model weights are downloaded automatically. Subsequent runs will be much faster.

### Managing Reference Genomes

Chorus includes built-in support for downloading and managing reference genomes:

```bash
# List available genomes
chorus genome list

# Download a reference genome (e.g., hg38, hg19, mm10)
chorus genome download hg38

# Get information about a downloaded genome
chorus genome info hg38

# Remove a downloaded genome
chorus genome remove hg38
```

Supported genomes:
- **hg38**: Human genome assembly GRCh38
- **hg19**: Human genome assembly GRCh37
- **mm10**: Mouse genome assembly GRCm38
- **mm9**: Mouse genome assembly NCBI37
- **dm6**: Drosophila melanogaster genome assembly BDGP6
- **ce11**: C. elegans genome assembly WBcel235

Genomes are stored in the `genomes/` directory within your Chorus installation.

## Quick Start

### Basic Setup

```python
import chorus
from chorus.utils import get_genome

# Create oracle with reference genome (auto-downloads if needed)
genome_path = get_genome('hg38')
oracle = chorus.create_oracle('enformer', 
                             use_environment=True,
                             reference_fasta=str(genome_path))
oracle.load_pretrained_model()

# Define tracks to predict (ENCODE IDs or descriptions)
tracks = ['ENCFF413AHU', 'CNhs11250']  # DNase:K562, CAGE:K562
```

#### Device Selection

By default, Chorus auto-detects and uses GPU if available. You can explicitly control device selection:

```python
# Force CPU usage (useful for testing or GPU memory issues)
oracle = chorus.create_oracle('enformer', 
                             use_environment=True,
                             reference_fasta=str(genome_path),
                             device='cpu')

# Use specific GPU (for multi-GPU systems)
oracle = chorus.create_oracle('enformer',
                             use_environment=True,
                             reference_fasta=str(genome_path),
                             device='cuda:1')  # Use second GPU

# Set default device via environment variable
# export CHORUS_DEVICE=cpu
```

#### Timeout Configuration

For slower systems or CPU-only environments, you may need to adjust timeouts:

```python
# Custom timeouts for slower systems
oracle = chorus.create_oracle('enformer', 
                             use_environment=True,
                             reference_fasta=str(genome_path),
                             model_load_timeout=1200,  # 20 minutes
                             predict_timeout=600)      # 10 minutes

# Combine device and timeout settings
oracle = chorus.create_oracle('enformer',
                             use_environment=True,
                             reference_fasta=str(genome_path),
                             device='cpu',             # Force CPU
                             model_load_timeout=1800,  # 30 minutes for CPU
                             predict_timeout=900)      # 15 minutes for CPU

# Disable all timeouts (use with caution)
oracle = chorus.create_oracle('enformer',
                             use_environment=True,
                             reference_fasta=str(genome_path),
                             model_load_timeout=None,
                             predict_timeout=None)

# Or set environment variable to disable all timeouts globally
# export CHORUS_NO_TIMEOUT=1
```

### 1. Wild-type Prediction

```python
# Predict from genomic coordinates
predictions = oracle.predict(
    ('chr11', 5247000, 5248000),  # Beta-globin locus
    tracks
)

# Or from DNA sequence
sequence = 'ACGT' * 98304  # 393,216 bp for Enformer
predictions = oracle.predict(sequence, tracks)
```

### 2. Region Replacement

```python
# Replace a 200bp region with enhancer sequence
enhancer = 'GATA' * 50  # 200bp GATA motif repeats
replaced = oracle.predict_region_replacement(
    'chr11:5247400-5247600',  # Region to replace
    enhancer,                  # New sequence
    tracks
)
```

### 3. Sequence Insertion

```python
# Insert enhancer at specific position
inserted = oracle.predict_region_insertion_at(
    'chr11:5247500',  # Insertion point
    enhancer,         # Sequence to insert
    tracks
)
```

### 4. Variant Effect

```python
# Test SNP effects (e.g., A→G mutation)
variant_effects = oracle.predict_variant_effect(
    'chr11:5247000-5248000',  # Region containing variant
    'chr11:5247500',          # Variant position
    ['A', 'G', 'C', 'T'],     # Reference first, then alternates
    tracks
)
```

### 5. Save Predictions

```python
# Save as BedGraph for genome browser
wt_files = predictions.save_predictions_as_bedgraph(output_dir="bedgraph_outputs",
                                                    prefix='a_wt')

```

## Key Features

### 1. Environment Isolation

Each oracle runs in its own conda environment to avoid dependency conflicts:

```python
# TensorFlow-based Enformer runs in isolated environment
enformer = chorus.create_oracle('enformer', use_environment=True)

# PyTorch-based Borzoi runs in its own isolated environment
borzoi = chorus.create_oracle('borzoi', use_environment=True)
```

### 2. Reference Genome Integration

For accurate predictions, provide a reference genome to extract proper flanking sequences:

```python
# Enformer requires 393,216 bp of context
# Chorus automatically extracts and pads sequences from the reference

# Option 1: Using get_genome() - simplest approach
from chorus.utils import get_genome
genome_path = get_genome('hg38')  # Auto-downloads if not present
oracle = chorus.create_oracle('enformer', 
                             use_environment=True,
                             reference_fasta=str(genome_path))

# Option 2: Using GenomeManager directly
from chorus.utils import GenomeManager
gm = GenomeManager()
genome_path = gm.get_genome('hg38')  # Auto-downloads if needed
oracle = chorus.create_oracle('enformer', 
                             use_environment=True,
                             reference_fasta=str(genome_path))

# Predict using genomic coordinates
predictions = oracle.predict(('chr1', 1000000, 1001000), ['DNase:K562'])
```

### 3. Track Support

**Note: ENCODE track identifiers and cell type descriptions are specific to Enformer model. Other oracles may use different track naming conventions.**

For Enformer:
```python
# Using ENCODE identifier (recommended for reproducibility)
predictions = oracle.predict(sequence, ['ENCFF413AHU'])  # Specific DNase:K562 experiment

# Using descriptive name
predictions = oracle.predict(sequence, ['DNase:K562'])

# Using CAGE identifiers
predictions = oracle.predict(sequence, ['CNhs11250'])  # CAGE:K562
```

For other oracles (Borzoi, ChromBPNet, Sei, etc.), track specifications will vary based on the model's training data.

### 4. BedGraph Output

Predictions can be saved as BedGraph tracks for genome browser visualization:

```python
# Predictions are returned as numpy arrays
# Each bin represents 128 bp for Enformer
# See examples for BedGraph generation code
```

## Core Concepts

### Oracles
Oracles are deep learning models that predict genomic regulatory activity. Each oracle implements a common interface while running in isolated environments.

### Intervals

Class as a unified interface to the reference genome/sequence. This component enables structured access to genomic coordinates while explicitly tracking and managing sequence edits together with their corresponding model predictions, thereby supporting reproducible in silico perturbation workflows and consistent downstream analysis.

### Tracks
Tracks represent genomic signal data (e.g., DNase-seq, ChIP-seq). Enformer predicts 5,313 human tracks covering various assays and cell types.

### Environment Management
The `chorus` CLI manages conda environments for each oracle:

```bash
# Set up environments
chorus setup --oracle enformer

# Check health
chorus health

# Clean up
chorus remove --oracle enformer
```

- Weights: Hosted on HuggingFace (gated repository, requires authentication)

#### AlphaGenome Setup

AlphaGenome weights are hosted on a **gated HuggingFace repository**. You must authenticate before first use:

1. **Create a HuggingFace account** at https://huggingface.co/join

2. **Accept the model license terms** at https://huggingface.co/google/alphagenome-all-folds (click "Agree and access repository")

3. **Generate a token** at https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens (read access is sufficient)

4. **Authenticate** via one of these methods:
```bash
# Option A: Set environment variable (recommended — works with automation and across envs)
export HF_TOKEN="hf_your_token_here"

# Option B: Interactive login (saves token to ~/.cache/huggingface/token)
mamba run -n chorus-alphagenome huggingface-cli login
```

5. **Set up the environment and verify**:
```bash
chorus setup --oracle alphagenome
chorus health --oracle alphagenome --timeout 300
```

#### AlphaGenome Usage

```python
import chorus
from chorus.utils import get_genome

genome_path = get_genome('hg38')

# Create and load oracle
oracle = chorus.create_oracle('alphagenome',
                              use_environment=True,
                              reference_fasta=str(genome_path),
                              device='cpu')  # or omit for auto-detect GPU
oracle.load_pretrained_model()

# Discover available tracks
print(oracle.list_assay_types())   # ['ATAC', 'CAGE', 'CHIP', 'DNASE', ...]
print(oracle.get_track_info('ATAC'))  # DataFrame of ATAC tracks

# Predict
tracks = ['ATAC/CL:0000084 ATAC-seq/.']  # T-cell ATAC-seq
predictions = oracle.predict(('chr1', 1_000_000, 2_048_576), tracks)
```

#### AlphaGenome GPU Support

AlphaGenome uses JAX, which supports multiple accelerator backends:

- **NVIDIA GPU (Linux)**: Automatically installs `jax[cuda12]` when NVIDIA GPU is detected during `chorus setup`
- **Apple Silicon (macOS)**: Automatically installs `jax-metal` for Metal GPU acceleration during `chorus setup`
- **CPU**: Works everywhere as fallback; pass `device='cpu'` to force CPU

```python
# Auto-detect best available device (GPU > Metal > CPU)
oracle = chorus.create_oracle('alphagenome', use_environment=True)

# Force specific device
oracle = chorus.create_oracle('alphagenome', use_environment=True, device='cpu')
oracle = chorus.create_oracle('alphagenome', use_environment=True, device='gpu')    # NVIDIA CUDA
oracle = chorus.create_oracle('alphagenome', use_environment=True, device='metal')  # Apple Metal
```

## Troubleshooting

### Timeout Issues
If you encounter timeout errors on slower systems:

```python
# Increase timeouts
oracle = chorus.create_oracle('enformer',
                             use_environment=True,
                             model_load_timeout=1800,  # 30 minutes
                             predict_timeout=900)      # 15 minutes

# Or disable timeouts entirely
export CHORUS_NO_TIMEOUT=1
```

Common timeout scenarios:
- **Model loading**: First-time downloads can be slow (~1GB model)
- **CPU predictions**: GPU is 10-100x faster than CPU
- **Network filesystems**: Add 50% to timeouts for NFS/shared storage

### Environment Issues
```bash
# Check if environment exists
chorus health

# Recreate environment
chorus remove --oracle enformer
chorus setup --oracle enformer
```

### Memory Issues
Some oracles require a significant memory (~8-16 GB) for predictions. Solutions:
- Force CPU usage: `device='cpu'`
- Use a different GPU: `device='cuda:1'`
- Reduce batch size if needed

### AlphaGenome Authentication
AlphaGenome weights are hosted on a gated HuggingFace repository. If you see a `GatedRepoError` or 403 error:

```bash
# 1. Accept model terms at https://huggingface.co/google/alphagenome-all-folds
# 2. Authenticate via environment variable (recommended)
export HF_TOKEN="hf_your_token_here"
# Or: mamba run -n chorus-alphagenome huggingface-cli login
```

### CUDA/GPU Support
The isolated environments include GPU support. On Linux with NVIDIA GPUs, Chorus auto-detects CUDA and installs GPU-enabled packages during `chorus setup`. On macOS with Apple Silicon, JAX-based oracles (AlphaGenome) can use Metal acceleration.

To force CPU usage when GPU causes issues:
```python
oracle = chorus.create_oracle('enformer',
                             use_environment=True,
                             device='cpu')
```
