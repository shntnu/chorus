- 🎯 In silico mutagenesis and sequence optimization
- 📈 Per-track quantile normalization with pre-computed genome-wide backgrounds (auto-downloaded from HuggingFace)
- 🚀 Enhanced sequence editing logic
- 🔧 Isolated conda environments for each oracle to avoid dependency conflicts
- 🧪 Sub-region scoring, gene expression analysis (CAGE + RNA-seq), and variant-to-gene effect prediction
- 🤖 MCP server for AI assistant integration (Claude, etc.)

## 👉 Start here: Worked application examples

The fastest way to see what Chorus can do is to browse the
[`examples/applications/`](examples/applications/) folder. Every subfolder is a
concrete, ready-to-reproduce use case with full outputs in **Markdown, JSON,
TSV, and HTML** (with an embedded IGV browser):

| I want to... | Example |
|---|---|
| Analyze a GWAS / clinical variant in a specific cell type | [variant_analysis/SORT1_rs12740374](examples/applications/variant_analysis/SORT1_rs12740374/) |
| Find which tissues a variant affects most | [discovery/SORT1_cell_type_screen](examples/applications/discovery/SORT1_cell_type_screen/) |
| Fine-map a GWAS locus to the causal SNP | [causal_prioritization/SORT1_locus](examples/applications/causal_prioritization/SORT1_locus/) |
| Score a batch of variants from a VCF | [batch_scoring/](examples/applications/batch_scoring/) |
| Predict the effect of an engineered sequence edit | [sequence_engineering/region_swap](examples/applications/sequence_engineering/region_swap/) |
| Replicate a published regulatory variant finding | [validation/SORT1_rs12740374_with_CEBP](examples/applications/validation/SORT1_rs12740374_with_CEBP/) |

These examples were generated through Claude Code using Chorus's MCP server —
the same way you'll use it. Every report preserves the original prompt at the
top, so you can see exactly what was asked and reproduce it.
See [`examples/applications/README.md`](examples/applications/README.md) for
the full list with per-persona ("Geneticist", "Bioinformatician", "Clinician",
"Computational biologist") starting points.

## Prerequisites

- **Miniforge** (provides `mamba`): Install from https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge
- **Git**
- ~20 GB free disk space (for models, genomes, and conda environments)
- Works on **Linux x86_64** and **macOS (Intel/Apple Silicon)**
- GPU support: NVIDIA CUDA (Linux) is auto-detected. Apple Metal is experimental and not fully supported by all oracles (see AlphaGenome section).

## Installation

### Fresh Install

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/pinellolab/chorus.git
cd chorus

# 1. Create the base chorus environment (uses the root environment.yml;
#    the per-oracle YAMLs in environments/ are installed for you by
#    `chorus setup` in the next step)
mamba env create -f environment.yml
mamba activate chorus

# 2. Install the chorus package + CLI (registers `chorus` and `chorus-mcp` commands)
pip install -e .

# 3. Register the chorus env as a Jupyter kernel so the example notebooks
#    in examples/*.ipynb pick up the right Python (the kernel they ship with
#    is plain `python3`, which on a fresh machine doesn't have chorus installed)
python -m ipykernel install --user --name chorus --display-name "Python 3 (chorus)"

# 4. Set up at least one oracle environment (see below)
chorus setup --oracle enformer   # lightweight CPU-friendly starter

# 5. Download the reference genome your analyses will need
chorus genome download hg38

# Verify installation
python -c "import chorus; print(f'chorus {chorus.__version__}')"
```

> **Two env files, one source of truth.** The root `environment.yml` is
> what you install. The per-oracle files in `environments/` are consumed
> internally by `chorus setup --oracle <name>` — you don't install them
> directly.

### Upgrading

After the first install, to upgrade cleanly:

```bash
cd chorus && git pull
mamba env remove -n chorus -y
# Repeat for each oracle you had installed:
chorus remove --oracle enformer
```

Then re-run the Fresh Install steps above.

### Setting Up Oracle Environments

Chorus uses isolated conda environments for each oracle to avoid dependency conflicts between TensorFlow, PyTorch, and JAX models.

**Which oracle to start with?** For variant analysis, **AlphaGenome** is the most comprehensive (1 Mb window, 1 bp resolution, 5,930 tracks) but requires ~16 GB RAM and benefits from a GPU. **Enformer** is a good lightweight alternative that runs comfortably on CPU with ~8 GB RAM.

```bash
# Set up all oracle environments
chorus setup --oracle alphagenome   # JAX-based — recommended primary oracle (see AlphaGenome section below for auth)
chorus setup --oracle enformer      # TensorFlow-based
chorus setup --oracle borzoi        # PyTorch-based
chorus setup --oracle chrombpnet    # TensorFlow-based (includes BPNet for TF binding)
chorus setup --oracle sei           # PyTorch-based
chorus setup --oracle legnet        # PyTorch-based

# List available environments
chorus list
```

You can check the correctness of installation using the following command:

```bash
# Check environment health (use --timeout for first run when models download)
chorus health --timeout 300
```

**Note:** The first health check (or first prediction) for each oracle may take several minutes as model weights are downloaded automatically. Subsequent runs will be much faster.

### Managing Reference Genomes

Chorus includes built-in support for downloading and managing reference genomes:

```bash
# List available genomes
chorus genome list

# Download a reference genome (e.g., hg38, hg19, mm10)
chorus genome download hg38

# Get information about a downloaded genome
chorus genome info hg38

# Remove a downloaded genome
chorus genome remove hg38
```

Supported genomes:
- **hg38**: Human genome assembly GRCh38
- **hg19**: Human genome assembly GRCh37
- **mm10**: Mouse genome assembly GRCm38
- **mm9**: Mouse genome assembly NCBI37
- **dm6**: Drosophila melanogaster genome assembly BDGP6
- **ce11**: C. elegans genome assembly WBcel235

Genomes are stored in the `genomes/` directory within your Chorus installation.

### Per-track background distributions (auto-downloaded)

Chorus converts every raw prediction into an **effect percentile** and
**activity percentile** against ~10,000 random SNPs and ~30,000 genome-wide
positions scored on the same oracle. These pre-computed per-track CDFs are
what let a user interpret a `+0.45` log2FC as `0.962 activity %ile`.

**Nothing to configure.** On the first variant analysis for a given
oracle, the relevant backgrounds are automatically fetched from the public
HuggingFace dataset
[`lucapinello/chorus-backgrounds`](https://huggingface.co/datasets/lucapinello/chorus-backgrounds)
and cached at `~/.chorus/backgrounds/`.

| Oracle | File size | Tracks covered |
|---|---|---|
| AlphaGenome | ~260 MB | 5,168 |
| Enformer | ~520 MB | 5,313 |
| Borzoi | ~770 MB | 7,611 |
| ChromBPNet | ~2.4 MB | per-model |
| Sei | ~2.8 MB | 40 classes |
| LegNet | ~210 KB | 3 cell types |

> **The backgrounds dataset is public — no HuggingFace token required.**
> `HF_TOKEN` is only needed for the gated AlphaGenome model itself (see
> the AlphaGenome section below). Causal prioritization with auto-LD-fetch
> needs a separate free LDlink token (see Troubleshooting).

To pre-download all backgrounds (optional, avoids the first-use wait):

```python
from chorus.analysis.normalization import download_pertrack_backgrounds
for oracle in ["alphagenome", "enformer", "borzoi", "chrombpnet", "sei", "legnet"]:
    download_pertrack_backgrounds(oracle)
```

## Quick Start

> **Prefer a notebook?** Open [`examples/single_oracle_quickstart.ipynb`](examples/single_oracle_quickstart.ipynb)
> for a full walkthrough using Enformer + the GATA1 locus. The code below is the
> minimum viable snippet.
>
> **Prerequisite for the snippet:** you've run `chorus setup --oracle enformer`
> and `chorus genome download hg38` (both in the Installation section).

### Minimal Working Example

```python
import chorus
from chorus.utils import get_genome

# 1. Create oracle with reference genome
genome_path = get_genome('hg38')  # auto-downloads if needed
oracle = chorus.create_oracle('enformer', use_environment=True,
                              reference_fasta=str(genome_path))
oracle.load_pretrained_model()

# 2. Predict DNase accessibility at the beta-globin locus.
#    'ENCFF413AHU' is the ENCODE track ID for DNase-seq in K562 cells;
#    use `oracle.list_tracks()` or see the "Discovering Tracks" section
#    below to find track IDs for other assays and cell types.
predictions = oracle.predict(('chr11', 5247000, 5248000), ['ENCFF413AHU'])

# 3. Check the result
track = predictions['ENCFF413AHU']
print(f"Mean signal: {track.values.mean():.2f}, Max: {track.values.max():.2f}")
```

### Discovering Tracks

Each oracle has thousands of tracks. Use the metadata to find the right ones:

```python
# List available assay types
print(oracle.list_assay_types())   # ['ATAC', 'CAGE', 'CHIP', 'DNASE']

# Search for tracks by keyword (e.g. cell type)
from chorus.oracles.enformer_source.enformer_metadata import get_metadata
meta = get_metadata()
k562_tracks = meta.search_tracks('K562')  # Returns DataFrame with 'identifier' column
print(k562_tracks[['identifier', 'description']].head())

# Use the 'identifier' column as track IDs for predictions
tracks = ['ENCFF413AHU', 'CNhs11250']  # DNase:K562, CAGE:K562
```

> **Tip:** Each oracle has different track naming. Enformer and Borzoi use ENCODE identifiers (e.g. `ENCFF413AHU`). ChromBPNet uses assay + cell type. AlphaGenome uses `{OutputType}/{TrackName}/{Strand}`. See the [Model-Specific Details](#model-specific-details) section for each oracle's track format.

### 1. Wild-type Prediction

```python
# Predict from genomic coordinates
predictions = oracle.predict(
    ('chr11', 5247000, 5248000),  # Beta-globin locus
    tracks
)

# Or from DNA sequence
sequence = 'ACGT' * 98304  # 393,216 bp for Enformer
predictions = oracle.predict(sequence, tracks)
```

### 2. Region Replacement

```python
# Replace a 200bp region with enhancer sequence
enhancer = 'GATA' * 50  # 200bp GATA motif repeats
replaced = oracle.predict_region_replacement(
    'chr11:5247400-5247600',  # Region to replace
    enhancer,                  # New sequence
    tracks
)
```

### 3. Sequence Insertion

```python
# Insert enhancer at specific position
inserted = oracle.predict_region_insertion_at(
    'chr11:5247500',  # Insertion point
    enhancer,         # Sequence to insert
    tracks
)
```

### 4. Variant Effect

```python
# Test SNP effects (e.g., A→G mutation)
variant_effects = oracle.predict_variant_effect(
    'chr11:5247000-5248000',  # Region containing variant
    'chr11:5247500',          # Variant position
    ['A', 'G', 'C', 'T'],     # Reference first, then alternates
    tracks
)
```

### 5. Sub-Region Scoring

```python
# Score a specific peak or promoter within the prediction window
# (instead of summarizing the entire 114 kb output)
score = predictions.score_region('chr11', 5247400, 5247600, 'mean')
# Returns {track_id: score} for all tracks

# Also available on individual tracks with different strategies
track = predictions['ENCFF413AHU']
track.score_region('chr11', 5247400, 5247600, 'max')   # peak signal
track.score_region('chr11', 5247400, 5247600, 'sum')   # total signal
```

### 6. Focused Variant Effect Scoring

```python
from chorus.core.result import score_variant_effect

# Score variant effects at the variant site (±N bins)
scores = score_variant_effect(variant_effects, at_variant=True, window_bins=2)
# Returns {allele: {track_id: {ref_score, alt_score, effect}}}

# Or score variant effects at a specific region (e.g. a nearby promoter)
scores = score_variant_effect(
    variant_effects,
    chrom='chr11', start=5247400, end=5247600,
    scoring_strategy='mean'  # mean, max, sum, median, or abs_max
)
```

### 7. Gene Expression Analysis

```python
# Quantify predicted gene expression from CAGE and/or RNA-seq tracks
# Auto-detects expression tracks and uses appropriate quantification:
#   CAGE/LentiMPRA → TSS windowed max
#   RNA-seq → exon sum (Borzoi/AlphaGenome)
expr = oracle.analyze_gene_expression(predictions, 'GATA1')
# Returns per-track expression values with quantification method

# Also available: get exon annotations for a gene
from chorus.utils.annotations import get_gene_exons
exons = get_gene_exons('GATA1')  # merged exon coordinates
```

### 8. Variant Effect on Gene Expression

```python
# The key question: does this variant change expression of a gene?
result = oracle.analyze_variant_effect_on_gene(variant_effects, 'GATA1')
# Returns fold change, log2 fold change, and absolute change per allele per track
```

### 9. Save Predictions

```python
# Save as BedGraph for genome browser
wt_files = predictions.save_predictions_as_bedgraph(output_dir="bedgraph_outputs",
                                                    prefix='a_wt')

```

## Example Notebooks

```bash
# Download reference genome first
chorus genome download hg38
```

Three notebooks are provided, from introductory to advanced:

| Notebook | Oracles | What it covers |
|----------|---------|----------------|
| `examples/single_oracle_quickstart.ipynb` | Enformer | Deep single-oracle tutorial: predictions, region replacement, insertion, variant effects, gene expression, coolbox visualization |
| `examples/comprehensive_oracle_showcase.ipynb` | All 6 | All oracles side by side, cross-oracle comparison, variant analysis with gene expression, sub-region scoring |
| `examples/advanced_multi_oracle_analysis.ipynb` | Enformer + ChromBPNet/BPNet + LegNet | CHIP-seq TF binding, strand-specific tracks, Interval API, quantile normalization, cell-type switching |

## Key Features

### 1. Environment Isolation

Each oracle runs in its own conda environment to avoid dependency conflicts:

```python
# TensorFlow-based Enformer runs in isolated environment
enformer = chorus.create_oracle('enformer', use_environment=True)

# PyTorch-based Borzoi runs in its own isolated environment
borzoi = chorus.create_oracle('borzoi', use_environment=True)
```

### 2. Reference Genome Integration

For accurate predictions, provide a reference genome to extract proper flanking sequences:

```python
# Enformer requires 393,216 bp of context
# Chorus automatically extracts and pads sequences from the reference

# Option 1: Using get_genome() - simplest approach
from chorus.utils import get_genome
genome_path = get_genome('hg38')  # Auto-downloads if not present
oracle = chorus.create_oracle('enformer', 
                             use_environment=True,
                             reference_fasta=str(genome_path))

# Option 2: Using GenomeManager directly
from chorus.utils import GenomeManager
gm = GenomeManager()
genome_path = gm.get_genome('hg38')  # Auto-downloads if needed
oracle = chorus.create_oracle('enformer', 
                             use_environment=True,
                             reference_fasta=str(genome_path))

# Predict using genomic coordinates
predictions = oracle.predict(('chr1', 1000000, 1001000), ['DNase:K562'])
```

### 3. Track Support

Track identifiers vary by oracle. Use the metadata search (see [Discovering Tracks](#discovering-tracks)) to find the right IDs.

For Enformer and Borzoi, you can use ENCODE identifiers or descriptive names in the Python API:
```python
# ENCODE identifier (recommended — works in both Python API and MCP)
predictions = oracle.predict(sequence, ['ENCFF413AHU'])  # DNase:K562

# Descriptive name (Python API only)
predictions = oracle.predict(sequence, ['DNase:K562'])

# CAGE identifier
predictions = oracle.predict(sequence, ['CNhs11250'])  # CAGE:K562
```

> **MCP users:** The MCP server requires ENCODE identifiers (e.g. `ENCFF413AHU`), not descriptive names. Use `list_tracks(oracle_name, query='K562')` to search and get the `identifier` field.

### 4. BedGraph Output

Predictions can be saved as BedGraph tracks for genome browser visualization:

```python
# Predictions are returned as numpy arrays
# Each bin represents 128 bp for Enformer
# See examples for BedGraph generation code
```

## Core Concepts

### Oracles
Oracles are deep learning models that predict genomic regulatory activity. Each oracle implements a common interface while running in isolated environments.

### Intervals

A unified interface to genomic coordinates and reference sequences. Intervals track sequence edits alongside their corresponding model predictions, supporting reproducible in silico perturbation workflows and consistent downstream analysis.

### Tracks
Tracks represent genomic signal data (e.g., DNase-seq, ChIP-seq). Enformer predicts 5,313 human tracks covering various assays and cell types.

### Environment Management
The `chorus` CLI manages conda environments for each oracle:

```bash
# Set up environments
chorus setup --oracle enformer

# Check health
chorus health

# Clean up
chorus remove --oracle enformer
```

## Model-Specific Details

### Enformer 

Enformer (Avsec et al., 2021) is a hybrid convolutional-transformer architecture
designed for long-range sequence-to-function modeling of regulatory
genomics, with the primary goal of predicting transcriptional and
epigenomic activity directly from DNA sequence.

- Sequence length: 393,216 bp input, 114,688 bp output window
- Output: 896 bins × 5,313 tracks
- Bin size: 128 bp
- Track types: Gene expression (CAGE), chromatin accessibility (DNase/ATAC), histone modifications (ChIP-seq)
- Track identifiers: 
  - ENCODE IDs (e.g., ENCFF413AHU for DNase:K562)
  - CAGE IDs (e.g., CNhs11250 for CAGE:K562)
  - Descriptive names (e.g., 'DNase:K562', 'H3K4me3:HepG2')
- Track metadata: Included in the package (file with all 5,313 human track definitions)

### Borzoi

Enhanced Enformer with improved performance and RNA-tracks predictions.

- Sequence length: 524,288 bp input, 196,608 bp output window
- Output: 6,144 bins × 7,610 tracks
- Bin size: 32 bp
- Track types: Gene expression (CAGE, RNA-Seq), chromatin accessibility (DNase/ATAC), histone modifications (ChIP-seq)

  - ENCODE IDs (e.g., ENCFF413AHU for DNase:K562)
  - CAGE IDs (e.g., CNhs11250 for CAGE:K562)
  - Descriptive names (e.g., 'DNase:K562', 'H3K4me3:HepG2')
- Track metadata: Included in the package (file with all 7,610 human track definitions)


### ChromBPNet / BPNet

Base-pair resolution for chromatin accessibility and TF binding predictions. This oracle supports two model types through the same interface:

- **ChromBPNet** (`assay="DNASE"` or `assay="ATAC"`): Predicts chromatin accessibility at base-pair resolution. Models are downloaded from ENCODE.
- **BPNet** (`assay="CHIP"`, `TF="GATA1"`): Predicts transcription factor binding at base-pair resolution. Models are downloaded from JASPAR.

Specs:
- Sequence length: 2,114 bp input
- Output: 1,000 bins at 1 bp resolution
- Track types: DNase/ATAC accessibility, TF binding (ChIP-seq)

```python
# ChromBPNet: chromatin accessibility
oracle = chorus.create_oracle('chrombpnet', use_environment=True,
                              reference_fasta=str(genome_path))
oracle.load_pretrained_model(assay="DNASE", cell_type="K562")

# BPNet: TF-specific binding prediction
oracle.load_pretrained_model(assay="CHIP", cell_type="K562", TF="GATA1")
```

#### Loading Custom Models

You can load your own ChromBPNet/BPNet weights (e.g. trained on a new cell type):

```python
oracle.load_pretrained_model(
    assay="DNASE",                   # DNASE, ATAC, or CHIP
    cell_type="HepG2",              # your cell type label
    weights='path/to/weights',      # path to your model weights
    is_custom=True                  # enables custom weight paths
)
```

- Output: 1 bin 
- Bin size: 4096 bp
- Track types: DNase accessibility, TF binding (CHIP-Seq), histone modifications 
- Track identifiers: 
  - custom Sei track identifiers
- Track metadata: Included in the package (files with all 21907 human track definitions and 41 Sei-defined classes)


### LegNet

LegNet is a fully convolutional neural network designed for efficient modeling of short regulatory DNA sequences.

- Sequence length: 200 bp input
- Output: 1 bin
- Bin size: 200 bp
- Track types: Element activity in MPRA experiment
- Track identifiers:
  - cell line names

### AlphaGenome

AlphaGenome (Google DeepMind, Nature 2026) predicts 5,930 human functional genomic tracks at single base-pair resolution from up to 1 MB of DNA sequence using a JAX-based model.

- Sequence length: 1,048,576 bp (1 MB) input
- Output: 1,048,576 bins at single base-pair resolution
- Bin size: 1 bp (ATAC, CAGE, DNase, RNA-seq, splice sites, PRO-CAP) or 128 bp (ChIP-seq histone/TF)
- Track types: ATAC, CAGE, ChIP-seq (histone + TF), DNase, RNA-seq, Splice sites, PRO-CAP
- Track identifiers: `{OutputType}/{TrackName}/{Strand}` (e.g., `ATAC/CL:0000084 ATAC-seq/.`)
- Weights: Hosted on HuggingFace (gated repository, requires authentication)

#### AlphaGenome Setup

AlphaGenome weights are hosted on a **gated HuggingFace repository**. You must authenticate before first use:

1. **Create a HuggingFace account** at https://huggingface.co/join

2. **Accept the model license terms** at https://huggingface.co/google/alphagenome-all-folds (click "Agree and access repository")

3. **Generate a token** at https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens (read access is sufficient)

4. **Authenticate** via one of these methods:
```bash
# Option A: Set environment variable (recommended — works with automation and across envs)
export HF_TOKEN="hf_your_token_here"

# Option B: Interactive login (saves token to ~/.cache/huggingface/token)
mamba run -n chorus-alphagenome huggingface-cli login
```

> **For MCP users**: Claude Code inherits environment variables from the
> shell where you start `claude`. Make sure `HF_TOKEN` is exported in that
> shell (e.g. add the `export` to your `~/.bashrc` or `~/.zshrc`).
> Option B (cached token) also works without any shell export.

5. **Set up the environment and verify**:
```bash
chorus setup --oracle alphagenome
chorus health --oracle alphagenome --timeout 300
```

#### AlphaGenome Usage

```python
import chorus
from chorus.utils import get_genome

genome_path = get_genome('hg38')

# Create and load oracle
oracle = chorus.create_oracle('alphagenome',
                              use_environment=True,
                              reference_fasta=str(genome_path),
                              device='cpu')  # or omit for auto-detect GPU
oracle.load_pretrained_model()

# Discover available tracks
print(oracle.list_assay_types())   # ['ATAC', 'CAGE', 'CHIP', 'DNASE', ...]
print(oracle.get_track_info('ATAC'))  # DataFrame of ATAC tracks

# Predict
tracks = ['ATAC/CL:0000084 ATAC-seq/.']  # T-cell ATAC-seq
predictions = oracle.predict(('chr1', 1_000_000, 2_048_576), tracks)
```

#### AlphaGenome GPU Support

AlphaGenome uses JAX, which supports multiple accelerator backends:

- **NVIDIA GPU (Linux)**: Automatically installs `jax[cuda12]` when NVIDIA GPU is detected during `chorus setup`
- **Apple Silicon (macOS)**: Uses **CPU** by default. `jax-metal` is installed but the Metal backend is experimental and does not yet support all operations AlphaGenome requires (e.g., `default_memory_space`). You can explicitly try `device='metal'` but expect errors.
- **CPU**: Works everywhere as fallback; pass `device='cpu'` to force CPU

```python
# Auto-detect best available device (CUDA GPU > CPU; Metal skipped for AlphaGenome)
oracle = chorus.create_oracle('alphagenome', use_environment=True)

# Force specific device
oracle = chorus.create_oracle('alphagenome', use_environment=True, device='cpu')
oracle = chorus.create_oracle('alphagenome', use_environment=True, device='gpu')    # NVIDIA CUDA
```

## MCP Server (AI Assistant Integration)

Chorus includes an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server that lets AI assistants like Claude
directly load oracles, predict variant effects, and analyze gene expression — all through
natural language conversation.

### Setup for Claude Code

**You do NOT need to run the server manually.** Claude Code manages the MCP server process
automatically. You just need a `.mcp.json` file — and it works from **any project folder**,
not just the Chorus repo.

**Step 1:** One-liner — run this from any project folder:

```bash
curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pinellolab/chorus/main/.mcp.json -o .mcp.json
```

Or create `.mcp.json` manually:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "chorus": {
      "type": "stdio",
      "command": "mamba",
      "args": ["run", "-n", "chorus", "chorus-mcp"],
      "env": {
        "CHORUS_NO_TIMEOUT": "1"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

The `chorus-mcp` command is installed in the `chorus` conda environment, so
`mamba run -n chorus chorus-mcp` works from any directory.

> **Note:** If you use `conda` instead of `mamba`, replace `"command": "mamba"` with `"command": "conda"`.
> The `CHORUS_NO_TIMEOUT` env var disables prediction timeouts, which is recommended for interactive use.

**Step 2:** Start (or restart) Claude Code from your project:

```bash
cd /path/to/my-project    # any folder — does NOT need to be the chorus repo
claude
```

Claude Code reads `.mcp.json` on startup and launches the MCP server in the background.
You should see the Chorus tools available immediately — try asking: *"What oracles are available?"*

**Alternatively**, you can add Chorus to your global Claude Code settings (`~/.claude/settings.json`)
so it's available in every project without needing a per-project `.mcp.json`:

```bash
# Add globally (one-time setup):
claude mcp add chorus -- mamba run -n chorus chorus-mcp
```

### Setup for Claude Desktop

Add this to your Claude Desktop MCP config (`~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json` on macOS):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "chorus": {
      "command": "mamba",
      "args": ["run", "-n", "chorus", "chorus-mcp"],
      "env": {
        "CHORUS_NO_TIMEOUT": "1"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Then restart Claude Desktop. Chorus tools will be available in all conversations.

### Manual testing (optional)

You can verify the server starts correctly by running it directly:

```bash
mamba run -n chorus chorus-mcp
# You should see the FastMCP banner. Press Ctrl+C to stop.
```

### Available MCP tools

- **Discovery**: `list_oracles`, `list_tracks`, `list_genomes`, `get_genes_in_region`, `get_gene_tss`
- **Lifecycle**: `load_oracle`, `unload_oracle`, `oracle_status`
- **Low-level prediction**: `predict`, `predict_variant_effect`, `predict_region_replacement`, `predict_region_insertion`
- **Scoring primitives**: `score_prediction_region`, `score_variant_effect_at_region`, `predict_variant_effect_on_gene`
- **Multi-layer analysis (recommended for most users)**:
    - `analyze_variant_multilayer` — score a variant across chromatin, TF, histone, CAGE, RNA, splicing in one call
    - `discover_variant` — find top tracks/cell types for a variant without pre-selecting assays
    - `discover_variant_cell_types` — screen hundreds of cell types to find where a variant matters most
    - `score_variant_batch` — rank many variants (VCF / GWAS set / credible set) by effect magnitude
    - `fine_map_causal_variant` — prioritize the causal SNP in a GWAS locus using multi-layer convergence
    - `analyze_region_swap`, `simulate_integration` — score sequence engineering edits (promoter swaps, construct insertions)

Every analysis tool accepts an optional `user_prompt` parameter and writes it into the top of the report so an HTML/MD opened later still shows the original question. See
[`examples/applications/`](examples/applications/) for worked outputs of each tool, or read the
[MCP Walkthrough](docs/MCP_WALKTHROUGH.md) for a step-by-step guide showing what you type in Claude
and what comes back.

Key features:
- **Auto-centering**: `region` is optional in variant tools — auto-sized for each oracle's output window
- **ChromBPNet/BPNet params**: `load_oracle("chrombpnet", assay="CHIP", cell_type="K562", TF="GATA1")`
- **TSS warnings**: `predict_variant_effect_on_gene` warns when the target gene TSS is outside the output window
- **Mixed-resolution**: AlphaGenome's 1bp DNASE + 128bp histone tracks score correctly in a single call

### Variant Analysis with AlphaGenome (Recommended)

AlphaGenome (1Mb window, 5930 tracks) is the recommended primary oracle for variant analysis.
It covers DNASE, ATAC, CAGE, RNA-seq, ChIP-seq histone marks, and TF binding in a single model.

Example conversation with Claude:

> **You:** *Load AlphaGenome and predict the effect of rs12740374 (chr1:109274968 G>T) on hepatocyte CAGE expression*
>
> Claude will call `load_oracle("alphagenome")`, then `predict_variant_effect(...)` with the right tracks,
> and return a summary of chromatin and expression effects.

See `docs/variant_analysis_framework.md` for the full 5-layer analysis guide
with track selection cheat sheets by disease area.

## Troubleshooting

### Device Selection

By default, Chorus auto-detects and uses GPU if available. You can explicitly control device selection:

```python
oracle = chorus.create_oracle('enformer', use_environment=True,
                              reference_fasta=str(genome_path),
                              device='cpu')       # Force CPU
# Or: device='cuda:1' for a specific GPU
# Or: export CHORUS_DEVICE=cpu
```

### Timeout Issues

For slower systems or CPU-only environments, you may need to adjust timeouts:

```python
oracle = chorus.create_oracle('enformer', use_environment=True,
                              reference_fasta=str(genome_path),
                              model_load_timeout=1800,  # 30 min (default 600)
                              predict_timeout=900)      # 15 min (default 300)

# Or disable all timeouts globally
# export CHORUS_NO_TIMEOUT=1
```

Common timeout scenarios:
- **Model loading**: First-time downloads can be slow (~1GB model)
- **CPU predictions**: GPU is 10-100x faster than CPU
- **Network filesystems**: Add 50% to timeouts for NFS/shared storage

### Environment Issues
```bash
# Check if environment exists
chorus health

# Recreate environment
chorus remove --oracle enformer
chorus setup --oracle enformer
```

#### Two mamba installs ⇒ `chorus health` reports phantom failures

If you have both `~/.local/share/mamba/` (typical when `mamba` is installed via
brew/pip) **and** a `~/miniforge3/` (typical when you originally installed via
the Miniforge installer), `mamba env create` may put the new `chorus` env in
one root while the per-oracle `chorus-*` envs live in the other. `chorus health`
then fails with `mamba list -n chorus-<oracle>` returning non-zero because the
running mamba is looking under the wrong root.

**Fix:** point `MAMBA_ROOT_PREFIX` at the root that contains the oracle envs
before invoking `chorus`:

```bash
export MAMBA_ROOT_PREFIX=$HOME/miniforge3   # or wherever your chorus-* envs live
mamba env list                              # confirm chorus-* envs show up
chorus health
```

Add the export to your shell rc file if you want it persistent.

### Memory Issues
Some oracles require a significant memory (~8-16 GB) for predictions. Solutions:
- Force CPU usage: `device='cpu'`
- Use a different GPU: `device='cuda:1'`
- Reduce batch size if needed

### AlphaGenome Authentication
AlphaGenome weights are hosted on a gated HuggingFace repository. If you see a `GatedRepoError` or 403 error:

```bash
# 1. Accept model terms at https://huggingface.co/google/alphagenome-all-folds
# 2. Authenticate via environment variable (recommended)
export HF_TOKEN="hf_your_token_here"
# Or: mamba run -n chorus-alphagenome huggingface-cli login
```

### LDlink Token (for causal prioritization)
The `fine_map_causal_variant` tool can auto-fetch LD proxies from LDlink.
This requires a free token — register at <https://ldlink.nih.gov/?tab=apiaccess>
and pass it via the `ldlink_token` parameter or set:

```bash
export LDLINK_TOKEN="your_token_here"
```

Without a token, you can still use fine-mapping by providing LD variants
manually via the `ld_variants` parameter (see
[causal_prioritization/](examples/applications/causal_prioritization/)).

### CUDA/GPU Support
The isolated environments include GPU support. On Linux with NVIDIA GPUs, Chorus auto-detects CUDA and installs GPU-enabled packages during `chorus setup`.

**On macOS with Apple Silicon**, Chorus auto-detects Apple GPU acceleration where supported:

| Oracle | Backend | macOS GPU path |
|---|---|---|
| Borzoi, Sei, LegNet | PyTorch | **MPS** auto-detected via `torch.backends.mps.is_available()` |
| ChromBPNet, Enformer | TensorFlow | **Metal** via `tensorflow-metal` (added automatically by `chorus setup` on macOS arm64) |
| AlphaGenome | JAX | **CPU** — `jax-metal` is installed but Apple's plugin doesn't yet support all ops AlphaGenome needs (e.g. `default_memory_space`); Chorus falls back to CPU |

You can always force a specific device:
```python
oracle = chorus.create_oracle('borzoi', use_environment=True, device='mps')   # Apple GPU
oracle = chorus.create_oracle('borzoi', use_environment=True, device='cpu')   # force CPU
oracle = chorus.create_oracle('borzoi', use_environment=True, device='cuda:0')  # NVIDIA
```

To force CPU usage when GPU causes issues:
```python
oracle = chorus.create_oracle('enformer',
                             use_environment=True,
                             device='cpu')
```

## Appendix: Per-track background distributions

This appendix describes how the per-track CDFs that power Chorus's
effect/activity percentiles were computed, what the numbers mean, and how
to use them from both the Python API and an MCP/Claude session.

### What they are and why they exist

A raw `log2FC = +0.45` in a DNase-seq track is hard to interpret. Is it
strong? Is the underlying region even active? The per-track backgrounds
turn that raw number into two complementary genome-aware percentiles:

| Percentile | What it measures | Computed from |
|---|---|---|
| **Effect percentile** | How unusual is *this* variant's effect on this track? | The distribution of variant-effect scores from ~10K random SNPs scored on the same track |
| **Activity percentile** | How active is the reference signal at the variant site, genome-wide? | The distribution of window-summed signal at ~31.5K diverse genomic positions |

Both range `[0, 1]` for unsigned layers (chromatin, ChIP, CAGE,
splicing). For signed layers (gene expression, MPRA, Sei), the effect
percentile ranges `[-1, 1]` (preserving the direction of effect).

The backgrounds are stored as 10,000-point CDFs per track in NPZ files
(one file per oracle, `~/.chorus/backgrounds/{oracle}_pertrack.npz`).
Each oracle's NPZ contains three matrices:

- `effect_cdfs (n_tracks × 10000)` — for the effect percentile
- `summary_cdfs (n_tracks × 10000)` — for the activity percentile
- `perbin_cdfs (n_tracks × 10000)` — for IGV per-bin rescaling
  (omitted for scalar-output oracles like Sei and LegNet)

### How they were calculated

The build scripts live in [`scripts/`](scripts/) — one per oracle. Each
performs three reservoir-sampled passes:

#### 1. Variant effect distribution

10,000 random SNPs sampled uniformly across `chr1`–`chr22`, well away
from chromosome edges. For each SNP:

1. Predict reference and alternate alleles across the full output window.
2. For each track, score the variant effect using the layer-specific
   formula:
   - **log2FC** for unsigned signal layers (chromatin, TF binding, histone
     marks, TSS) — variant effect = `log2((sum_alt + ε) / (sum_ref + ε))`
     in a layer-appropriate window (501 bp for DNase/ChIP-TF/CAGE,
     2001 bp for histone marks, full transcript for RNA).
   - **logFC** for gene expression — `log2(mean_alt / mean_ref)` averaged
     over GENCODE protein-coding exons of the target gene.
   - **diff** for promoter MPRA — simple `alt - ref` activity difference.
3. Add `|effect|` (unsigned) or raw `effect` (signed) to that track's
   reservoir.

Result: per-track histograms over real human-genome variant effects.

#### 2. Activity (window-sum) distribution

~31,500 positions per track sampled to approximate the genome-wide
distribution of regulatory activity:

| Position type | Count | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| Random intergenic | 15,000 | Genome-wide null (most genome is silent) |
| ENCODE SCREEN cCREs (per category) | ~11,500 | PLS, dELS, pELS, CA-CTCF, CA-TF, TF, CA-H3K4me3, CA |
| Protein-coding TSSs | 3,000 | Sharp signals: CAGE, H3K4me3, promoter activity |
| Gene-body midpoints (>10 kb genes) | 2,000 | RNA-seq, H3K36me3, broad gene-body marks |

For each position, the layer-appropriate window-sum is added to the
track's reservoir.

**RNA-seq exon-precise sampling** (Borzoi, AlphaGenome): RNA tracks only
collect bins overlapping merged GENCODE v48 protein-coding exons —
intronic bins would distort the activity baseline.

**CAGE summary routing**: CAGE tracks skip cCRE positions for the summary
CDF since CAGE biology lives at TSSs, not enhancers.

#### 3. Per-bin distribution (for IGV visualization)

At each of the same ~31,500 positions, **32 random bins** from the full
output window are added to the perbin reservoir. This captures the
per-bin (not per-window) distribution at the track's native resolution
(1 bp for ATAC/CAGE/RNA/PRO-CAP/splice; 128 bp for ChIP-Histone/TF in
AlphaGenome).

The per-bin CDFs are used by `perbin_floor_rescale_batch` to rescale
raw IGV bin values onto a uniform `[0, 1.5]` display scale where
`1.0` always corresponds to the top-1% genome-wide bin value for that
track. This makes overlaid tracks visually comparable across cell types.

### Sample sizes per oracle

| Oracle | Tracks | Effect samples / track | Activity samples / track | NPZ size |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| AlphaGenome | 5,168 | 10,000 | 31,500 | 260 MB |
| Enformer | 5,313 | 10,000 | 31,500 | 520 MB |
| Borzoi | 7,611 | 10,000 | 31,500 | 770 MB |
| ChromBPNet | per-model | 10,000 | 31,500 | 2.4 MB |
| Sei | 40 classes | 10,000 | 31,500 | 2.8 MB |
| LegNet | 3 cell types | 10,000 | 31,500 | 210 KB |

Effect and activity reservoirs are converted to 10,000-point CDFs (sorted
sample arrays) — so a percentile lookup is a single O(log n) bisect.

### Using backgrounds from the Python API

Auto-load (downloads from HuggingFace if not cached):

```python
from chorus.analysis.normalization import get_pertrack_normalizer

norm = get_pertrack_normalizer("alphagenome")
# → ~/.chorus/backgrounds/alphagenome_pertrack.npz (auto-downloaded if missing)
```

Look up an effect or activity percentile for a single track:

```python
track_id = "DNASE/EFO:0001187 DNase-seq/."  # HepG2 DNase

# How unusual is a +0.45 log2FC effect? (unsigned: pass abs value)
eff_pct = norm.effect_percentile("alphagenome", track_id, abs(0.45),
                                 signed=False)
# → 0.962  (stronger than 96.2% of random SNPs in this track)

# How active is the reference signal at the variant site?
act_pct = norm.activity_percentile("alphagenome", track_id, ref_value=512.0)
# → 0.962  (top 4% of genome-wide regulatory activity for this track)
```

Pass it into the analysis layer to get percentiles attached to every
report:

```python
from chorus.analysis.variant_report import build_variant_report

report = build_variant_report(
    variant_result,
    oracle_name="alphagenome",
    gene_name="SORT1",
    normalizer=norm,    # ← this is what populates the Effect %ile / Activity %ile columns
)
```

Or pre-download all six oracles' backgrounds once:

```python
from chorus.analysis.normalization import download_pertrack_backgrounds
for o in ["alphagenome", "enformer", "borzoi", "chrombpnet", "sei", "legnet"]:
    download_pertrack_backgrounds(o)
```

### Using backgrounds via MCP / Claude

You don't have to do anything. The MCP server auto-attaches the
appropriate normalizer when you call any analysis tool
(`analyze_variant_multilayer`, `score_variant_batch`,
`fine_map_causal_variant`, `analyze_region_swap`, `simulate_integration`,
`discover_variant`, `discover_variant_cell_types`).

The first call for a given oracle triggers a one-time HuggingFace
download (a few hundred MB), cached at `~/.chorus/backgrounds/`.
Subsequent calls reuse the cache.

In the resulting report, every track row gets two extra columns —
`Effect %ile` and `Activity %ile` — and the IGV browser uses the per-bin
CDFs to rescale bin heights for cross-cell-type comparability.

### Documented ranges and how to read the numbers

| Column | Range | Reading |
|---|---|---|
| **Raw effect** (e.g. log2FC) | unbounded; biologically meaningful units | `+1.0` = alt is 2× ref; `-1.0` = alt is 0.5× ref |
| **Effect percentile** (unsigned) | `[0, 1]` | `0.95` = stronger than 95% of ~10K random SNPs in the same track |
| **Effect percentile** (signed) | `[-1, 1]` | `+0.95` = strongly above-baseline gain; `-0.95` = strongly above-baseline loss |
| **Activity percentile** | `[0, 1]` | `0.95` = reference signal at this site is in the top 5% genome-wide for this track |
| **IGV per-bin display value** | `[0, 1.5]` | `1.0` = top-1% bin value genome-wide for this track; `0` = below the noise floor |

**Sanity-check rule of thumb:** a *biologically interesting* variant
typically shows **effect percentile > 0.95** AND **activity percentile >
0.5** in the same track — i.e. an unusually large effect at a site that
already has real regulatory activity.

A high effect percentile with very low activity is usually noise (small
absolute change at a silent site that just happens to be larger than
most random-SNP-at-silent-sites changes).

### Reproducing or extending the backgrounds

Each oracle has a build script at `scripts/build_backgrounds_<oracle>.py`.
Each takes ~4–22 GPU-hours per oracle depending on the track count and
output window. To rebuild a single oracle:

```bash
mamba run -n chorus-alphagenome python scripts/build_backgrounds_alphagenome.py --part variants  --gpu 0
mamba run -n chorus-alphagenome python scripts/build_backgrounds_alphagenome.py --part baselines --gpu 1
mamba run -n chorus              python scripts/build_backgrounds_alphagenome.py --part merge
```

The variants and baselines parts can run in parallel on separate GPUs.
The merge step runs CPU-only and combines the interim NPZ files into the
final `{oracle}_pertrack.npz`. See [`scripts/README.md`](scripts/README.md)
for the full per-oracle commands and runtimes.

If you've rebuilt a background and want to share it: drop the resulting
`{oracle}_pertrack.npz` into `~/.chorus/backgrounds/`. The downloader
will not overwrite local files — it only fetches when the file is
missing.
